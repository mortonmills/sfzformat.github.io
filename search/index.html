    "body": "This opcode range allows defining a specific point along the amplifier velocity curve. The value of the opcode indicates the normalized amplitude (0 to 1)for the specified velocity. N can be from 0 to 127. The player will interpolate lineraly between specified opcodes for unspecified ones: amp_velcurve_1=0. 2 amp_velcurve_3=0. 3// amp_velcurve_2 is calculated to 0. 25If amp_velcurve_127 is not specified, the player will assign it the value of 1. Examples: There are several common ways to use this opcode. One is to reduce the dynamic rangeso that low-velocity notes will still produce a fairly loud sound. This is similar(but probably not quite identical mathematically) to setting amp_veltrack to lessthan 100. // linear, compressed dynamic range// amplitude changes from 0. 5 to 1amp_velcurve_1=0. 5It can also be used to set up a specific velocity response. amp_velcurve_1=0. 1amp_velcurve_63=0. 25amp_velcurve_95=0. 5This opcode is also often used with dynamic layers to make each sample play at its fullamplitude at the top of its velocity layer, as shown below for a kick drum withfour dynamic layers. Note that there’s no reason to set amp_velcurve_N values for Nbelow the lovel or above the hivel for a particular region. So, in practice, this oftenends up meaning just setting amp_velcurve_N=1 with N being equal to the hivel value foreach layer. &lt;region&gt;hivel=31 amp_velcurve_31=1 sample=kick_vl1. wav&lt;region&gt;lovel=32 hivel=63 amp_velcurve_63=1 sample=kick_vl2. wav&lt;region&gt;lovel=64 hivel=95 amp_velcurve_95=1 sample=kick_vl3. wav&lt;region&gt;lovel=96 sample=kick_vl4. wavThis could also be combined with the first example so that velocity 1 hits will stillbe reasonably audible. &lt;region&gt;hivel=31 amp_velcurve_1=0. 3 amp_velcurve_31=1 sample=kick_vl1. wav&lt;region&gt;lovel=32 hivel=63 amp_velcurve_63=1 sample=kick_vl2. wav&lt;region&gt;lovel=64 hivel=95 amp_velcurve_95=1 sample=kick_vl3. wav&lt;region&gt;lovel=96 sample=kick_vl4. wavPractical Considerations: As a MIDI velocity 0 note is a note-off message, amp_velcurve_0 never actually needsto be set. It just creates a slightly different starting point for one side of theinterpolation, compared to setting amp_velcurve_1. By default, amp_velcurve_0 iseffectively 0. If amp_velcurve is not set for any N, then amp_velcurve_0 is 0 andamp_velcurve_127 is 1, and the volume for notes with velocity is the same as ifamp_velcurve_1=0. 007874016. Both amp_velcurve_n and amp_veltrack can be used together, though there’s probablymore risk of confusion than benefit to doing this.

In ARIA, the SFZ1 envelopes have linear attack (for pitcheg and fileg,probably linear in cents, which won’t translate into linear in Hertz). Decay and release stages have a curve which is faster than linear, and itseems to match “well enough” with a multiplicatively decreasing curve. The step size should be close to\(\mu = \exp \left( - \frac{8. 0}{t \times s} \right)\)where \(t\) is the decay duration in seconds, and \(s\) is the sample rate in Hertz. The envelope \(x_{n+1}\) at index \(n+1\) is thus computed as\(x_{n+1} = \mu \times x_{n}. \) Here is a screenshot of a file output using Sforzando, showing theampeg_envelope shape and its stages.  "

    "body": "A SFZ file is a set of plain text, computer-readable instructions, whichaccompany a sample set and define how the sampler should load and work withthose samples. If the samples are the strings of a piano or pipes of an organ,the SFZ file is the mechanism that connects the key to the hammer which strikesthe strings or the air and signals to the pipes of the organ. SFZ files can be opened, edited, and created in any text editor application,even the default ‘Notepad’ in Windows. No external software is necessaryto create or modify a SFZ file, though there are some pieces of softwareor scripts out there which greatly ease the creation or editing process. An example of this is an automapper, which is a script or application that takesa sample set and uses the names of the samples or actual audio contentto determine how to map those samples. The SFZ file’s role is a simple, two-part operation:  Explain how to filter or sort the incoming MIDI data and determine which sample(s), if any, should sound in response.  Instruct the Sampler how to modulate, or adapt, those samples, such as make them quieter or apply a filter. Incoming MIDI Data ---&gt; Sampler - - - - - - - - -&gt; Audio Output             |               ^            SFZ File ---&gt; Sample1. wav    |                 ---&gt; Sample2. wav &gt;&gt; Modulation                 ---&gt; Sample3. wavOpcodes: The primary component of any SFZ file is the opcode. Opcodes essentially define‘thing=value’. For example, the opcode ‘volume=6’ defines the volumeof the sample as +6 decibels relative to normal. Opcodes functionally perform two different roles: (1) defining performance parameters,or (2) restricting the conditions under which that sound may be used. For example,volume=6 defines a performance property: the sample will sound 6 decibels louder. On the other hand, lokey=36 hikey=38 limits what conditionthe sound may play: the key to trigger the sound must be in the range 36 through 38. You can think of your SFZ file as a giant conditional filter, which systematically takes a MIDI message and attempts to perform a specific action in response. At the most basic level, if you simply type &lt;region&gt;sample=piano. wavThen that sample will be mapped to MIDI key 60 (middle C), and be available at ALL velocity ranges, ALL key ranges, and under ALL continuous controller values (i. e. regardless of if sustain pedal is held down or not, for example). If we add lokey=58 hikey=62 pitch_keycenter=60 to the region, then our piano note will ONLY respond if a key within the range 58-62 (Bb to D on either side of middle C) is played. We are restricting the conditions under which that specific sample will be played. We can restrict whether or not a specific sample will play by a very wide range of parameters, including which keys are pressed, at what velocity, and what MIDI continuous controller (CC) values are currently present. For example, we can have a piano sample for when the sustain pedal is down AND velocity is less than 20 AND the key pressed is between 58 and 62 as follows: &lt;region&gt;sample=piano. wavpitch_keycenter=60 //here we define the real  concert  pitch of the sample, MIDI note 60 or middle Clokey=58 //here we set the range of pitches the region will play onhikey=62lovel=1 //here we set the range of key velocities that the region will play onhivel=20locc64=64 //here we set that the sustain pedal, cc64, must be on for the region to playhicc64=127If for any reason the MIDI signal DOES NOT meet ALL of the conditions, that sample will not play. That is the basic underlying framework on how SFZ files are organized. Headers: Headers serve to organize and separate opcodes, and are marked with &lt; &gt;on either side. There are three primary headers: &lt;region&gt;, &lt;group&gt;,and &lt;global&gt;, from most to least restrictive. A region, for example,may only contain a single sample. A group is comprised of a series of regions,each containing a single sample. A global is comprised of a series of groups,each containing a series of regions, etc. &lt;control&gt; is a special purpose header used for a few special opcodessuch as default_path. Generally SFZ instruments are not indented, but if they were,they would appear as such: &lt;control&gt;&lt;global&gt;	&lt;group&gt;		&lt;region&gt;			sample=		&lt;region&gt;			sample=	&lt;group&gt;		&lt;region&gt;			sample=		&lt;region&gt;			sample=Inheriting: Note that if you entered an opcode between a &lt;group&gt; and its first &lt;region&gt;,that opcode would be inherited by the &lt;region&gt;s within the group. The same can be done for &lt;global&gt; as well, with &lt;global&gt; affecting all of the&lt;group&gt;s within it, and that being passed down to each of the &lt;region&gt;s withinthose groups as welll, allowing the parameters of dozens,hundreds, or thousands of samples to be altered with a single line. This massivelycuts down on file size, as you do not need to repeat the same text in each item. &lt;group&gt;lovel=64 // enter stuff here if you want to apply it to all regionshivel=127&lt;region&gt;sample=Trumpet_C4_v2. wavkey=60&lt;region&gt;sample=Trumpet_C#4_v2. wavkey=61&lt;region&gt;sample=Trumpet_D4_v2. wavkey=62is the same as: &lt;region&gt;sample=Trumpet_C4_v2. wavkey=60lovel=64hivel=127&lt;region&gt;sample=Trumpet_C#4_v2. wavkey=61lovel=64hivel=127&lt;region&gt;sample=Trumpet_D4_v2. wavkey=62lovel=64hivel=127This behavior can be overriden if that same opcode is specified withinthe lesser header with a different value. For example: &lt;global&gt;	volume=6 //this value will be inherited by everything, unless overriden below	&lt;group&gt; //Group A		volume=5		&lt;region&gt; //Region 1			volume=4		&lt;region&gt; //Region 2	&lt;group&gt; //Group B		&lt;region&gt; //Region 3			volume=2		&lt;region&gt; //Region 4(indented for clarity; SFZ is not usually indented) Here’s what’s going on here:  Region 1’s volume is 4, as it has volume defined.  Region 2’s volume is 5, as it doesn’t have volume defined,so it inherits from Group A, as Group A has volume defined.  Region 3’s volume is 2, as it has volume defined.  Region 4’s volume is 6 as it doesn’t have volume defined, nor does Group B,so it inherits from the Global volume setting which is 6. Always look for opportunities to use inheriting to keep your scripts tidyby removing duplicate code. Header Nesting: Unlike many popular scripting or programming languages or markup languages like HTML, XML, JSON, etc. there is no such concept as nesting in SFZ. Nesting is when a header of the same type can exist within another header of the same type. Nesting is very useful, but it can add a lot of complexity and layers to a language, and is a common source of bugs or mistakes as well as a slight impediment of speed. The downside to the lack of nesting is that the number of layers is restricted severely rather than infinite. That is why there is both &lt;group&gt; and &lt;global&gt;, and the ARIA Player/Sforzando will also use an intermediate between the two, &lt;master&gt; to provide one more layer. In SFZ format, a header ends when the next header of that type is started. For example, if I put a &lt;region&gt; after another &lt;region&gt;, it will end the first region automatically at the start of declaring the next. Keep in mind that group, global, and master are merely macros to reduce duplicate code. When compiled (in most SFZ players), the SFZ file will run as if everything is inside the regions themselves. Organization of Opcodes within Headers: Opcodes may be listed in a row OR one per line, unofficially known as ‘condensed’ and ‘expanded’ view: &lt;region&gt;sample=piano_D4_vl1. wavlokey=62hikey=63pitch_keycenter=62lovel=1hivel=50is equal to: &lt;region&gt; sample=piano_D4_vl1. wav lokey=62 hikey=63 pitch_keycenter=62 lovel=1 hivel=50You can see how much space is saved in the latter case, and it allows bulk adjustments to be done easier and makes debugging slightly easier, e. g. : &lt;region&gt; sample=piano_D4_vl1. wav lokey=62 hikey=63 pitch_keycenter=62 lovel=1 hivel=50&lt;region&gt; sample=piano_E4_vl1. wav lokey=64 hikey=65 pitch_keycenter=64 lovel=1 hivel=50&lt;region&gt; sample=piano_F#4_vl1. wav lokey=66 hikey=67 pitch_keycenter=66 lovel=11 hivel=50&lt;region&gt; sample=piano_G#4_vl1. wav lokey=68 hikey=69 pitch_keycenter=68 lovel=1 hivel=50You can see there is something wrong with the third region, a typo of lovel=11 instaed of lovel=1. These four lines would replace over 20 lines, making files much more manageable. It is possible to swap between the two by using a find-and-replace operation in your text editor (e. g. Notepad++ or equivalent) to replace new line character with a space (this can be done by selecting a blank line by clicking and dragging down on a blank so that one line is highlighted, THEN open the find/replace dialog and it will be auto-filled in the ‘find’ field; put a single space in the ‘replace with’ field. Try executing and see if it works; see the video below for a visual representation of the process). https://www. youtube. com/watch?v=Lr7_qS2iV30 Pitch: If using a pitch based instrument, you will most likely be working heavily withthree opcodes: lokey, hikey, and pitch_keycenter. These opcodes define the rangeof MIDI note numbers or note names that will allow the note to play. It is highly recommended that you use MIDI note numbers, as pitch namingconventions are poorly standardized at best. You can remember the MIDI note numbers for the C’s as follows,using International Pitch Notation, which states C4=MIDI note number 60: C1:24C2: 36 (this is the C below bass clef)C3: 48 (this is the C in bass clef)C4: 60 (this is Middle C)C5: 72 (this is the C in treble clef)C6: 84 (this is the C above treble clef)C7: 96(note that many, many samplers use a different standard of C3=60,in which case all numbers are shifted down one; in fact, this is probably much more commonly found) You’ll notice each value is exactly 12 notes apart from the others. It’s not too difficult to calculate notes between the C’s, or keep a charton your wall or desk with the note names and MIDI numbers listed out. Many hours have been saved debugging and mapping for me in this way. Velocity Layers: For most instruments, it is possible to perform notes of varying intensity. For classically trained musicians, this might be called dynamics (such as piano, forte, mezzo-forte, etc. ). For a piano, when a key is struck with minimal force versus a great deal of force, a rather different tone is emitted, with harder strikes having more higher frequency content present. In the MIDI world, we refer to this as Velocity, borrowing the term from the world of physics. In the original MIDI spec, velocity has a range of 1-127 (aside: a velocity value of ‘0’ is actually an alias of ‘note off’ signal, so the actual range is 1-127, not 0-127). So, to make a realistic piano (or really most any instrument), it is necessary to sample the tone of the instrument at several different dynamic levels or velocities. We collectively refer to these sets of levels as Velocity Layers or Dynamic Layers. For example, let us say we record a piano with three such velocity layers. The softest layer might be what a classically trained pianist might call piano or pianissimo (p or pp marking). The moderate layer might be mezzo-forte (mf), and the hardest layer fortissimo (ff). In SFZ, we would assign each layer to a velocity range from the 1-127 range. For example, the lowest layer might get the range of 1-50, the medium from 51-100, and the loudest from 101-127. We express this in SFZ using lovel and hivel, for example: &lt;region&gt;sample=piano_C4_vl1. wavlovel=1hivel=50&lt;region&gt;sample=piano_C4_vl2. wavlovel=51hivel=100&lt;region&gt;sample=piano_C4_vl3. wavlovel=101hivel=127We would of course also add our lokey, hikey, and pitch_keycenter to these as well if we recorded multiple tones on the instrument. Using Velocity with Groups &amp; Inheriting: To simplify our lives and keep our SFZ files from being huge, we can also use the &lt;group&gt; header to organize our velocity layers, for example. Any &lt;region&gt; within a &lt;group&gt; will of course inherit whatever is listed in that &lt;group&gt;, so if we group our samples as shown below, we can significantly cut down on the amount of space needed in the file: &lt;group&gt; //velocity layer 1 (pp)lovel=1hivel=50&lt;region&gt; //C4sample=piano_C4_vl1. wavlokey=60hikey=61pitch_keycenter=60&lt;region&gt; //D4sample=piano_D4_vl1. wavlokey=62hikey=63pitch_keycenter=62&lt;region&gt; //E4sample=piano_E4_vl1. wavlokey=64hikey=64pitch_keycenter=64&lt;region&gt; //F4sample=piano_F4_vl1. wavlokey=65hikey=66pitch_keycenter=65&lt;group&gt; //velocity layer 2 (mf)lovel=51hivel=100&lt;region&gt; //C4sample=piano_C4_vl2. wavlokey=60hikey=61pitch_keycenter=60&lt;region&gt; //D4sample=piano_D4_vl2. wavlokey=62hikey=63pitch_keycenter=62&lt;region&gt; //E4sample=piano_E4_vl2. wavlokey=64hikey=64pitch_keycenter=64&lt;region&gt; //F4sample=piano_F4_vl2. wavlokey=65hikey=66pitch_keycenter=65&lt;group&gt; //velocity layer 3 (ff)lovel=101hivel=127&lt;region&gt; //C4sample=piano_C4_vl3. wavlokey=60hikey=61pitch_keycenter=60&lt;region&gt; //D4sample=piano_D4_vl3. wavlokey=62hikey=63pitch_keycenter=62&lt;region&gt; //E4sample=piano_E4_vl3. wavlokey=64hikey=64pitch_keycenter=64&lt;region&gt; //F4sample=piano_F4_vl3. wavlokey=65hikey=66pitch_keycenter=65Keep in mind of course that we can always override the inheriting behavior here, such as in the case of a sample for which only two velocity layers were recorded. This might happen in the case of a mistake, or in the case where time was running short in the session, or in some cases where the instrument physically has less distinction between its quietest and loudest sounds and it was desirable to save some time. You can also use group, master, and global to organize other things than velocity layers, such as keys, sustain pedal state, round robins, mic positions, and more. Just be careful as in some cases you might run out of headers to use if the file gets too complex, such as if you are using multiple mic positions, round robins, and grouping your velocity layers as well. Includes: One final more advanced topic to discuss is Includes. Perhaps the dark magic of SFZ, #include allows you to take the contents of one SFZ file and import them into your current file. This allows another layer of organiziation to take place, with, for example, all of the samples for each drum in a drum kit to exist in a separate . sfz file without an assigned key range, and a single master . sfz file to inherit each of those into a &lt;group&gt; where their key range is assigned (see Virtuosity Drums as a good example of this process). This might also be useful for an acoustic instrument to organize by mic position or articulation. This allows you to keep an extremely tidy workflow, creating easily-managed main files where you can rapidly change key ranges and other control values to get the controls you need. "

    "title": "Brush stirs",
    "body": "Not all drum sounds are hits which can be used in the usual way described in ourdrum basics article. One major exception are brush techniques which involvescraping the brush across a drum head, often in a circle. If you are not sure whatthis looks or sounds like, this video is a good guide. These techniques are called swirls or stirs, and for the purpose of this articlewe’ll call them stirs. As the sound changes in intensity, and the durationof the scrapes needs to fit the tempo and rhythm of the song, sampling themrequires a different approach to the usual drum hits. The two common approachesare to completely ignore this technique and not sample it at all, and to recordloops to fit various tempos. This article describes another approach. The key principle hereis that stirs are a noisy, nonlinear sound with a lot of randomness, whichmakes them very easy to crossfade or loop with no phase issues. Therefore,instead of trying to record stirs performed in a realistic way, we proposerecording long, unrealistically steady stirs with no perceptible rhythm orexpression, and then using those samples as source material for building upa musical stir. Recording the source material: For the purposes of this example, let’s assume the source stirs are recordedat four speeds, with 1 being the slowest and 4 being the fastest. Speed 1 isslow enough that a full circle around the head of the drum is completed inmore than 4 seconds. That’s enough to fill a measure at 60 bpm and still havesome sound left, so the user can start the next stir before the previous oneends, and thus achieve a continuous sound. Speed 4 is several circles persecond, to match the speed at which the brush would be moving during the peakof an aggressive stir. Making the sound steady at this speed is a challenge. As for how long the recordings need to be, speed 1 needs to be long enoughfor the longest stir we want to be able to make. However, if tuning controlsare to be applied, it’s important to remember that pitching a sample upshortens it, so if the tuning range is to extend to one octave up, then a10-second sample is the minimum to make a 5-second stir. Speeds 3 and 4are not used thorughout the duration of a stir but only for peaks, and forthe purposes of this example they can be half the length of speed 1. Simple stir model: We can make a very simple stir using speed 1 by playing the sample withloop_mode set to one_shot, like we normally would set it for adrum hit, and using a simple volume envelope to fade this samplein over a time, and then fade it out. &lt;region&gt;key=26 loop_mode=one_shotsample=snare_stir_speed_1. wavampeg_attack=1. 0 ampeg_decay=1. 0 ampeg_sustain=0The resulting volume envelope will look something like this. The illustrations arenot precise, only general shapes.  This is a good start, and we can add expression and realism by layering afaster speed on top of it near the stir’s peak, with half the durationof the base layer. We use ampeg_delay to delay the start of the secondlayer by the same amount, so the peaks of both layers align in time. &lt;region&gt;key=26 loop_mode=one_shotsample=snare_stir_speed_1. wavampeg_attack=1. 0 ampeg_decay=1. 0 ampeg_sustain=0&lt;region&gt;key=26 loop_mode=one_shotsample=snare_stir_speed_3. wavampeg_delay=0. 5 ampeg_attack=0. 5 ampeg_decay=0. 5 ampeg_sustain=0 Modulating stir duration: This has a fixed duration and is not flexible, but the stir length caneasily be modulated by a single CC parameter changing all theenvelope durations. Extremely short stirs, lasting only a small fractionof a second, are obviously not going to sound realistic, so we can usea minimum value to prevent that. Let’s use CC1 (standard mod wheel). &lt;region&gt;key=26 loop_mode=one_shotsample=snare_stir_speed_1. wavampeg_attack=0. 1 ampeg_decay=0. 1 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_attackcc1=0. 4 ampeg_decaycc1=0. 4&lt;region&gt;key=26 loop_mode=one_shotsample=snare_stir_speed_3. wavampeg_delay=0. 05 ampeg_attack=0. 05 ampeg_decay=0. 05 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_delaycc1=0. 25 ampeg_attackcc1=0. 25 ampeg_decaycc1=0. 25Making the shape more realistic: Drummers testing the above model have asked for some adjustments tomake it sound more realistic. One is to make the first half of the baselayer steadier. This can be done very easily by shortening the attackand adding a hold time to the envelope, ensuring that they still add upto the same amount of time that the faster layer’s delay and attack,so the peak will remain aligned at all values of the modulationparameter. The attack stage should generally be shorter than the holdstage. &lt;region&gt;key=26 loop_mode=one_shotsample=snare_stir_speed_1. wavampeg_attack=0. 05 ampeg_hold=0. 05 ampeg_decay=0. 1 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_attackcc1=0. 05 ampeg_holdcc1=0. 35 ampeg_decaycc1=0. 4&lt;region&gt;key=26 loop_mode=one_shotsample=snare_stir_speed_3. wavampeg_delay=0. 05 ampeg_attack=0. 05 ampeg_decay=0. 05 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_delaycc1=0. 25 ampeg_attackcc1=0. 25 ampeg_decaycc1=0. 25 Also, the peak should be sharper and more accented than it iswith linear envelopes. Changing the envelope curves accomplishes this,though the initial attack envelope of the base layer can remainlinear. The below values seem like a decent start. &lt;region&gt;key=26 loop_mode=one_shotsample=snare_stir_speed_1. wavampeg_attack=0. 05 ampeg_hold=0. 05 ampeg_decay=0. 1 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_attackcc1=0. 05 ampeg_holdcc1=0. 35 ampeg_decaycc1=0. 4ampeg_attack_shape=0. 0 ampeg_decay_shape=-1. 4&lt;region&gt;key=26 loop_mode=one_shotsample=snare_stir_speed_3. wavampeg_delay=0. 05 ampeg_attack=0. 05 ampeg_decay=0. 05 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_delaycc1=0. 25 ampeg_attackcc1=0. 25 ampeg_decaycc1=0. 25ampeg_attack_shape=3. 5 ampeg_decay_shape=-1. 4 Adjusting the envelope shapes: The above fixed envelope shapes are good for medium tempos and energy levels,but for slow tempos the flat envelope shapes actually work quite well, andmore energetic tracks might sound better with even sharper envelope peaks. Itwould be nice to adjust the envelope curve shapes with MIDI CC, but it is notcurrently possible to do this. It’s possible to work around this by crossfadingsharp-envelope and flat-envelope regions, or use locc/hicc to select betweenseveral pre-baked envelope shapes. Here’s an example of the latter method. &lt;group&gt;key=26 loop_mode=one_shot&lt;region&gt;hicc100=42sample=snare_stir_speed_1. wavampeg_attack=0. 05 ampeg_hold=0. 05 ampeg_decay=0. 1 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_attackcc1=0. 05 ampeg_holdcc1=0. 35 ampeg_decaycc1=0. 4ampeg_attack_shape=0. 0 ampeg_decay_shape=0. 0&lt;region&gt;hicc100=42sample=snare_stir_speed_3. wavampeg_delay=0. 05 ampeg_attack=0. 05 ampeg_decay=0. 05 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_delaycc1=0. 25 ampeg_attackcc1=0. 25 ampeg_decaycc1=0. 25ampeg_attack_shape=0. 0 ampeg_decay_shape=0. 0&lt;region&gt;locc100=43 hicc100=86sample=snare_stir_speed_1. wavampeg_attack=0. 05 ampeg_hold=0. 05 ampeg_decay=0. 1 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_attackcc1=0. 05 ampeg_holdcc1=0. 35 ampeg_decaycc1=0. 4ampeg_attack_shape=0. 0 ampeg_decay_shape=-1. 4&lt;region&gt;locc100=43 hicc100=86sample=snare_stir_speed_3. wavampeg_delay=0. 05 ampeg_attack=0. 05 ampeg_decay=0. 05 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_delaycc1=0. 25 ampeg_attackcc1=0. 25 ampeg_decaycc1=0. 25ampeg_attack_shape=3. 5 ampeg_decay_shape=-1. 4&lt;region&gt;locc100=87sample=snare_stir_speed_1. wavampeg_attack=0. 05 ampeg_hold=0. 05 ampeg_decay=0. 1 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_attackcc1=0. 05 ampeg_holdcc1=0. 35 ampeg_decaycc1=0. 4ampeg_attack_shape=0. 0 ampeg_decay_shape=-3. 5&lt;region&gt;locc100=87sample=snare_stir_speed_3. wavampeg_delay=0. 05 ampeg_attack=0. 05 ampeg_decay=0. 05 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_delaycc1=0. 25 ampeg_attackcc1=0. 25 ampeg_decaycc1=0. 25ampeg_attack_shape=5. 2 ampeg_decay_shape=-3. 5Adding ornaments: So far, we have a stir with adjustable duration and shape which peakshalfway through. More complex patterns can have more than one peak,though. A simple way to emulate that is to use a differnet MIDI noteto trigger short ornaments which will add a brief extra sound to thestir, thus emulating a momentary acceleration of the brush. We can useone of the higher stir speeds for this. &lt;group&gt;key=27 loop_mode=one_shot sample=snare_stir_speed_2. wavampeg_attack=0. 05 ampeg_decay=0. 05 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_attackcc1=0. 2 ampeg_decaycc1=0. 2&lt;region&gt;hicc100=42ampeg_attack_shape=0. 0 ampeg_decay_shape=0. 0&lt;region&gt;hicc100=42ampeg_attack_shape=3. 5 ampeg_decay_shape=-1. 4&lt;region&gt;hicc100=42ampeg_attack_shape=5. 2 ampeg_decay_shape=-3. 5Accents: We can also create accents, which are similar to the typical stir but peak muchmore quickly and use faster speeds. In pracitce, they can be used either asshort, aggressive stirs, or added on top of basic stirs to create more complexpatterns. The difference in the SFZ here is that the attack curve shape can be applied tothe attack portion as well, and there is no hold stage in the envelope. &lt;group&gt;key=28 loop_mode=one_shot&lt;region&gt;hicc100=42sample=snare_stir_speed_2. wavampeg_attack=0. 05 ampeg_decay=0. 1 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_attackcc1=0. 05 ampeg_decaycc1=0. 4ampeg_attack_shape=0. 0 ampeg_decay_shape=0. 0&lt;region&gt;hicc100=42sample=snare_stir_speed_4. wavampeg_attack=0. 05 ampeg_decay=0. 05 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_attackcc1=0. 05 ampeg_decaycc1=0. 2ampeg_attack_shape=0. 0 ampeg_decay_shape=0. 0&lt;region&gt;locc100=43 hicc100=86sample=snare_stir_speed_2. wavampeg_attack=0. 05 ampeg_decay=0. 1 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_attackcc1=0. 05 ampeg_decaycc1=0. 4ampeg_attack_shape=3. 5 ampeg_decay_shape=-1. 4&lt;region&gt;locc100=43 hicc100=86sample=snare_stir_speed_4. wavampeg_attack=0. 05 ampeg_decay=0. 05 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_attackcc1=0. 05 ampeg_decaycc1=0. 2ampeg_attack_shape=3. 5 ampeg_decay_shape=-1. 4&lt;region&gt;locc100=87sample=snare_stir_speed_2. wavampeg_attack=0. 05 ampeg_decay=0. 1 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_attackcc1=0. 05 ampeg_decaycc1=0. 4ampeg_attack_shape=5. 2 ampeg_decay_shape=-3. 5&lt;region&gt;locc100=87sample=snare_stir_speed_4. wavampeg_attack=0. 05 ampeg_decay=0. 05 ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_attackcc1=0. 05 ampeg_decaycc1=0. 2ampeg_attack_shape=5. 2 ampeg_decay_shape=-3. 5Muting: As all the above sounds have loop_mode set to one_shot, triggering a note causesthe sound to play until the volume envelope drops to zero. If ending a stirearlier than that is required, we can use polyphony groups. The groupand off_by opcodes are the key ones here. We can use them to make stirsself-mute, so that triggering a new stir will mute any previously playing stirs,as well as add a key which produces no sound, using silence instead of a sample,butis in the same mute groups, so triggering this key will mute any stir or accentcurrently playing. This key can be used to stop stirs early.

That is left as an exercise to the reader. Alternative approach: The above approach was developed to be playable from an electronic drum kitcontroller. For keyboard controllers or sequencing, another approach is possiblewhere instead of using a MIDI note to trigger a new stir every time the drummerwould complete a circle, we hold down a long note for as long as we want to producestirs (so, possibly for several measures, or even the entire duration of a song). We then use MIDI CC to crossfade between the layers tomodulate the speed of the stir in order to create realism and rhythmic interest. In order to be able to do this, the samples will have to be looped, but as statedat the beginning, looping or crossfading noisy samples is very easy as there areno phase issues. We also set the loop_mode opcode to continuousinstead of the one_shot setting used in the earlier approach. &lt;group&gt;key=26 loop_mode=continuous ampeg_release=0. 25&lt;region&gt;sample=snare_stir_speed_1. wav xfin_locc1=0 xfin_hicc1=31 xfout_locc1=32 xfout_hicc1=63&lt;region&gt;sample=snare_stir_speed_2. wav xfin_locc1=32 xfin_hicc1=63 xfout_locc1=64 xfout_hicc1=95&lt;region&gt;sample=snare_stir_speed_3. wav xfin_locc1=64 xfin_hicc1=95 xfout_locc1=96 xfout_hicc1=127&lt;region&gt;sample=snare_stir_speed_4. wav xfin_locc1=96 xfin_hicc1=127In practice, this approach has proven more difficult to use, with it being easyto sound obviously unrealistic by moving the MIDI CC parameter too quickly orstaying at high values for too long. With care, however, it can produce realisticresults, and it is extremely flexible. Further possibilities: The brush flutter technique can be treated similarly to the base layer of the stirs. There is no need to layer faster and slower flutters. In theory, this approachcould also be extended to other noisy, highly nonlinear sounds which can varyin duration - perhaps shakers. The main challenge there would be to record shakersshaking smoothly for an extended duration. It is also certainly possible to further improve the above model with more realismand playablity. "

    "body": "A lot of the information in this article deals with implementing sampled hi-hatsand cymbals in general, and although the code examples are in SFZ, the principlesshould also apply to other samplers, or even synthesized cymbals. Muting previously played notes is important with monophonic instruments, such asflutes or trumpets. With hi-hats, it is also crucial to sounding like a hi-hat -an open hi-hat hit will be muted in real life when the hi-hat pedal is closed. Let’s start with a simple hi-hat with closed hit, foot chik, half-open and opensamples, with the latter two on the same key and degree of openness selected byMIDI CC 4 - the common hi-hat pedal assignment in electronic drum kits. &lt;region&gt;key=42 sample=hh_closed. wav&lt;region&gt;key=44 sample=hh_chik. wav&lt;region&gt;key=46 sample=hh_half_open. wav hicc4=63&lt;region&gt;key=46 sample=hh_open. wav locc4=64Simple self-muting: The above hi-hat has no muting implemented, so playinga closed hit after an open one would result in the open hit unrealisticallycontinuing to ring. The simplest way to take care of that is to put all theregions in the same ‹group› and use off_by to make that group mute itself -that will mean any hi-hat hit will mute any currently playing hi-hat hit. Setting off_mode to normal and using ampeg_releaseor off_time to set the time it takes for the previous sample to fade outalso helps this sound a bit more natural. &lt;group&gt;off_mode=normalampeg_release=0. 07&lt;region&gt;key=42 sample=hh_closed. wav group=1 off_by=1&lt;region&gt;key=44 sample=hh_chik. wav group=1 off_by=1&lt;region&gt;key=46 sample=hh_half_open. wav hicc4=63 group=1 off_by=1&lt;region&gt;key=46 sample=hh_open. wav locc4=64 group=1 off_by=1Hierarchical self-muting: This is the way many virtual drum kits work, but it is not fully satisfactory if,for example, playing a ride pattern on an open hi-hat. Things do start getting morecomplicated here, though, and many developers feel that it’s enough to stop here, justimplement the above rules, and have a reasonably working virtual hi-hat. For thosewho want more, however, Peter L. Jones has developed a hierarchy of muting, wherehits which are more closed mute hits that are more open, but hits which aremore open do not mute hits which are more closed. Hits also don’t mute hits withthe same degree of openness. So, chiks mute all hits, closed hits mute any partially open hits but not chiksor closed hits etc. With this amount of degrees of openness, half-open hits wouldmute open hits, and open hits would mute nothing. So, we need to put each hi-hatarticulation in a different group. This, however, means we need a group whichmutes several other groups, and regions in a group cannot have multiple orvarying off_by values. So, what we have to do is use silence - either the silence*setting of sample ARIA extension, or an actual file of a short silence. Note that the silence samples also have to have off_by settingsthe same as the hi-hat samples in their mute group. Also, since group 1 doesn’tmute anything, we don’t need to add any silence regions to that group. Note that the group opcode used here and the ‹group›header are completely separate concepts - “group” for the remainder of thisarticle refers to the opcode, not the header, though group headers are also usedin the code examples. &lt;group&gt;// Here are the hi-hat samplesoff_mode=normalampeg_release=0. 07&lt;region&gt;key=42 sample=hh_closed. wav group=3 off_by=4&lt;region&gt;key=44 sample=hh_chik. wav group=4&lt;region&gt;key=46 sample=hh_half_open. wav hicc4=63 group=2 off_by=3&lt;region&gt;key=46 sample=hh_open. wav locc4=64 group=1 off_by=2&lt;group&gt;group=2 off_by=3// The range which mutes open hi-hats - that is, everything except opensample=*silenceloop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fastampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0&lt;region&gt; key=42&lt;region&gt; key=44&lt;region&gt; key=46 hicc4=63&lt;group&gt;group=3 off_by=4// The range which mutes half-open and open hi-hats - that is, closed and chikloop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fastampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0&lt;region&gt; key=42&lt;region&gt; key=44&lt;group&gt;group=4// The range which mutes closed, half-open and open hi-hats - that is, just chikloop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fastampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0&lt;region&gt; key=44Special treatment of foot splashes: The above isn’t perfect - for example, fully opening up a hi-hat after playinga hard half-open hit in the real world would stop the clashes between the topand bottom, effectively stopping a half-open sound and replacing it with quieteropen ringing - but it is a reasonable compromise covering various degrees ofopenness. Also, the more degrees of openness there are, the more groups will be needed. There are, however, more hi-hat articulations possible. One which has specialbehavior when it comes to muting is the foot splash - closing the hi-hat withthe pedal, then quickly reopening it. This articulation needs to mute itself,because playing one foot splash after another involves closing the hi-hat, whichwill mute the ringing. Whether the splash should mute other types of hits is an open question, however. Splashes, especially gentler ones, involve only momentary contact of the cymbaledges and not complete closure. Whether an open hi-hat hit followed by a splashsounds better when the splash mutes the open hit is left as a decision to thereader. The below example has the splash muting everything else, except for pedal chiks,because it invovles closing the hi-hat fully. So, if akit has foot splash samples (for which there is no standard general MIDI noteassignment, so let’s use 54 here - an octave above the chik, though in generalMIDI that’s supposed to be the cowbell note), we’d need to set up one more group,and have that mute itself. It will also need to be muted by all other types ofhi-hat hits, except for fully open hits. &lt;group&gt;//Here are the hi-hat samplesoff_mode=normalampeg_release=0. 07&lt;region&gt;key=42 sample=hh_closed. wav group=4 off_by=5&lt;region&gt;key=44 sample=hh_chik. wav group=5&lt;region&gt;key=46 sample=hh_half_open. wav hicc4=63 group=3 off_by=4&lt;region&gt;key=46 sample=hh_open. wav locc4=64 group=2 off_by=3&lt;region&gt;key=54 sample=hh_splash. wav group=1 off_by=1&lt;group&gt;group=1 off_by=1//The range which mutes foot splashes - everything except open and foot splash//Foot splash mutes itself, but this group does not include the foot splash key//That's because the foot splash samples themselves are in the same groupsample=*silenceloop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fastampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0&lt;region&gt; key=42&lt;region&gt; key=44&lt;region&gt; key=46&lt;group&gt;group=3 off_by=4//The range which mutes open hi-hats - that is, everything except opensample=*silenceloop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fastampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0&lt;region&gt; key=42&lt;region&gt; key=44&lt;region&gt; key=46 hicc4=63&lt;region&gt; key=54&lt;group&gt;group=4 off_by=5//The range which mutes half-open and open hi-hats - that is, closed, chik and foot splashsample=*silenceloop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fastampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0ampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0&lt;region&gt; key=42&lt;region&gt; key=44&lt;region&gt; key=54&lt;group&gt;group=5//The range which mutes closed, half-open and open hi-hats - that is, just chik and foot splashsample=*silenceloop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fastampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0ampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0&lt;region&gt; key=44&lt;region&gt; key=54Limiting polyphony: This works reasonably well. Another potential refinement is to also avoidexcessive buildup when the more open articulations (which with some hi-hat pairscan ring for upwards of 20 seconds), while still allowing enough for ridepatterns on an open hi-hat to sound right. We can do this by using the polyphonyopcode to put a limit on the number of polyphony voices used by a specific group. Note this must be set for the silence regions, also, so that every region in agroup will have the same off_by and polyphony as all the other regions in thatgroup. Polyphony of 4 for the open hi-hats and 3 for the half-open are judgmentcalls. Drier cymbals and articulations with less sustain will generally soundrealistic with lower numbers here, and brushes might need a lower number thansticks. Limiting the polyphony for the more closed articulations is not necessaryin practice, unless playing unrealistically dense trap hi-hat patterns, becausethey don’t ring very long anyway. Limiting the polyphony for the foot splash isnot necessary at all, because it mutes itself. &lt;group&gt;//Here are the hi-hat samplesoff_mode=normalampeg_release=0. 07&lt;region&gt;key=42 sample=hh_closed. wav group=4 off_by=5&lt;region&gt;key=44 sample=hh_chik. wav group=5&lt;region&gt;key=46 sample=hh_half_open. wav hicc4=63 group=3 off_by=4 polyphony=3&lt;region&gt;key=46 sample=hh_open. wav locc4=64 group=2 off_by=3 polyphony=4&lt;region&gt;key=54 sample=hh_splash. wav group=1 off_by=1&lt;group&gt;group=1 off_by=1//The range which mutes foot splashes//All sounds except open mute foot splashes, but this group does not include the foot splash key//That's because the foot splash samples are in the same group, and will mute anything elsesample=*silenceloop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fastampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0&lt;region&gt; key=42&lt;region&gt; key=44&lt;region&gt; key=46 hicc4=63&lt;group&gt;group=3 off_by=4 polyphony=3//The range which mutes open hi-hats - that is, everything except open and foot splashsample=*silenceloop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fastampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0&lt;region&gt; key=42&lt;region&gt; key=44&lt;region&gt; key=46 hicc4=63&lt;region&gt; key=54&lt;group&gt;group=4 off_by=5//The range which mutes half-open and open hi-hats - that is, closed, chik and foot splashsample=*silenceloop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fastampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0ampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0&lt;region&gt; key=42&lt;region&gt; key=44&lt;region&gt; key=54&lt;group&gt;group=5//The range which mutes closed, half-open and open hi-hats - that is, just chik and foot splashsample=*silenceloop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fastampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0ampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0&lt;region&gt; key=44Edge cases: The above can sound strange when a hard hi-hat hit is being muted by a much quieter one. Ifthe hit doing the muting is both quiet and short, it can be practically inaudible, and theresulting sound seems to only be the open hit, suddenly fading out. This is especially riskyif using amp_veltrack set to 100, which will make hits with very low velocity extremely quiet,or if the lowest dynamic layers of more closed hits and foot chiks are recorded very quietly. Lowering amp_veltrack for the lowest velocity layers is one potential way to reduce thisproblem, as is setting amp_velcurve_1 to some value around 0. 2 to 0. 5 (higher values if thereare more dynamic layers). In real life, however, a hard open hi-hat hit would have reduced in volume before the startof the soft closed hit, as the pedal needs to be closed before a closed hit can be made. This would, of course, cause many edge clashes along the way, which we do not have a wayto emulate. However, it is possible to use the pedal’s MIDI CC to make the open sample quieteroutside of the range where the open hi-hat sample would be triggered. This can be done by modulatingthe hi-hat’s amplitude, and applying a ‹curve› which willkeep the amplitude at 100% unless the pedal is a good deal more closed than it was when the sample was triggered. &lt;group&gt;//Here are the hi-hat samplesoff_mode=normalampeg_release=0. 07&lt;region&gt;key=42 sample=hh_closed. wav group=4 off_by=5&lt;region&gt;key=44 sample=hh_chik. wav group=5&lt;region&gt;key=46 sample=hh_half_open. wav hicc4=63 group=3 off_by=4 amplitude_cc4=100 amplitude_curvecc4=21 amplitude_smoothcc4=150&lt;region&gt;key=46 sample=hh_open. wav locc4=64 group=2 off_by=3 amplitude_cc4=100 amplitude_curvecc4=21 amplitude_smoothcc4=150&lt;region&gt;key=54 sample=hh_splash. wav group=1 off_by=1&lt;curve&gt;curve_index=21v000=0. 13v037=0. 8v077=1v127=1&lt;curve&gt;curve_index=22v000=0. 1v037=0. 7v077=1v127=1Using smoothing on the amplitude modulation helps avoid sudden jumps, though playing anopen hit, closing the hi-hat pedal most of the way and then reopening it will stillresult in obviously unrealistic volume fluctuations. So, this is not a perfect solutionby any means. It’s probably better to do this by using a volume envelope and using CC4 to modulate itsdecay time, with the sustain set to a low level. and the ampeg_dynamic opcodeset to 1 so that moving the pedal will cause the decay time to be recalculated. However, that has not been tested yet, as the author’s test kit was already using envelopeson the hi-hat to emulate drier cymbals. Also, applying this to splash samples, which involve the pedal starting closed and openingrapidly, is another problem which requires a solution. Multimic samples: So far, each hi-hat articulation has only one sample, which will obviously notbe the case in most virtual drum kits. This does not add much complexity, though,as the samples for each degree of openness simply need to all be in the same group. All half-open samples, for example, including all round robins, all velocity layers,can share the same group. If there are separate articulations for each degree of openness, such as shank,tip and bell, those can also all be on the same group. Brushes, sticks andmallets can often also share the same groups, unless the brushes need lowerpolyphony numbers. However, if there are separate samples for differentmicrophones and the groups are self-muting, they will need to be in differentgroups. In the current example, only the footsplash is self-muting, but if usingthe simpler rules where all hi-hat articulations mute all others, all groups areself-muting. So, having separate close hi-hat mic and a stereo overhead pairwould mean twice as many of those groups (assuming the stereo overheads are inthe L and R channel of the same sample), and close hi-hat, stereo overheads,close room and far room would mean four times as many. The polyphony numbers forgroups which have polyphony will also have to be multiplied by the same factor. Here is an example with close and overhead, with slightly longer fadeout timesfor the more distant overhead mics: &lt;group&gt;//Here are the hi-hat samplesoff_mode=normal&lt;region&gt;key=42 sample=hh_closed_close. wav group=4 off_by=5 ampeg_release=0. 12&lt;region&gt;key=42 sample=hh_closed_oh. wav group=4 off_by=5 ampeg_release=0. 2&lt;region&gt;key=44 sample=hh_chik_close. wav group=5 ampeg_release=0. 12&lt;region&gt;key=44 sample=hh_chik_oh. wav group=5 ampeg_release=0. 2&lt;region&gt;key=46 sample=hh_half_open_close. wav hicc4=63 group=3 off_by=4 polyphony=6 ampeg_release=0. 12&lt;region&gt;key=46 sample=hh_half_open_oh. wav hicc4=63 group=3 off_by=4 polyphony=6 ampeg_release=0. 2&lt;region&gt;key=46 sample=hh_open_close. wav locc4=64 group=2 off_by=3 polyphony=8 ampeg_release=0. 12&lt;region&gt;key=46 sample=hh_open_oh. wav locc4=64 group=2 off_by=3 polyphony=8 ampeg_release=0. 2&lt;region&gt;key=54 sample=hh_splash_close. wav group=1 off_by=1 ampeg_release=0. 12&lt;region&gt;key=54 sample=hh_splash_oh. wav group=11 off_by=11 ampeg_release=0. 2&lt;group&gt;group=1 off_by=1//The range which mutes foot splashes for the close mic//All sounds except open mute foot splashes, but this group does not include the foot splash key//That's because the foot splash samples are in the same group, and will mute anything elsesample=*silenceloop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fastampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0&lt;region&gt; key=42&lt;region&gt; key=44&lt;region&gt; key=46 hicc4=63&lt;group&gt;group=11 off_by=11//The range which mutes foot splashes for the overhead mics//All sounds mute foot splashes, but this group does not include the foot splash key//That's because the foot splash samples are in the same group, and will mute anything elsesample=*silenceloop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fastampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0&lt;region&gt; key=42&lt;region&gt; key=44&lt;region&gt; key=46 hicc4=63&lt;group&gt;group=3 off_by=4 polyphony=3//The range which mutes open hi-hats for both close and overhead mics - that is, everything except opensample=*silenceloop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fastampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0&lt;region&gt; key=42&lt;region&gt; key=44&lt;region&gt; key=46 hicc4=63&lt;region&gt; key=54&lt;group&gt;group=4 off_by=5//The range which mutes half-open and open hi-hats - that is, closed, chik and foot splashsample=*silenceloop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fastampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0ampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0&lt;region&gt; key=42&lt;region&gt; key=44&lt;region&gt; key=54&lt;group&gt;group=5//The range which mutes closed, half-open and open hi-hats - that is, just chiksample=*silenceloop_mode=loop_continuous off_mode=fastampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0ampeg_attack=0 ampeg_decay=0 ampeg_sustain=0 ampeg_release=0&lt;region&gt; key=44Header organization: That is as complex as it gets, though there are a few minor points to be aware of. Many drum kits with round robins will set seq_lengthat the ‹global› level, and in those cases, the silence regionswould only trigger for the first hit in the round robin sequence, unless theyhave seq_length set to 1 to override the global setting. Also, the ‹master›header level and #include statement are useful ARIAextensions for keeping deeply sampled hi-hat mappings organized. Cymbals other than hi-hats: Cymbals other than hi-hats are simpler, but there aretwo considerations when muting those. One is limiting polyphony, which isespecially important with cymbals intended for playing rolls, and with jazz ridecymbals (rock/metal rides which primarily use the bell articulation, not as much). The other is that it’s also possible to record separate choke samples, and havethose mute everything else. A ride with bell, bow and edge articulations, chokesamples and overhead and room mics might be set up like below. Note that whileeach articulation has its own groups and different polyphony limits, allarticulations for each mic have the same off_by value, which is the group valueof the choke samples for that mic. It would not be necessary to have this manygroups to implement muting, but this setup would also allow a mapping using onlythe overhead mics and no room mic to be created without breaking anything, aseach mic’s samples have separate groups. Having different polyphony numbers fordifferent mics can result in an inconsistent sound, so it is not recommended. &lt;group&gt;off_mode=normal//Bow hits&lt;region&gt;key=51 group=30 off_by=33 polyphony=5 ampeg_release=0. 3sample=ride_bow_oh. wav&lt;region&gt;key=51 group=40 off_by=43 polyphony=5 ampeg_release=0. 4sample=ride_bow_rm. wav//Bell hits&lt;region&gt;key=53 group=31 off_by=33 polyphony=4 ampeg_release=0. 3sample=ride_bell_oh. wav&lt;region&gt;key=53 group=41 off_by=43 polyphony=4 ampeg_release=0. 4sample=ride_bell_rm. wav//Edge hits (crashes)&lt;region&gt;key=59 group=32 off_by=33 polyphony=6 ampeg_release=0. 3sample=ride_edge_oh. wav&lt;region&gt;key=59 group=42 off_by=43 polyphony=6 ampeg_release=0. 4sample=ride_edge_rm. wav//Edge chokes&lt;region&gt;key=71 ampeg_attack=0. 15 group=33sample=ride_choke_oh. wav&lt;region&gt;key=71 ampeg_attack=0. 15 group=43sample=ride_choke_rm. wavIt is also possible to use note_polyphony here, whichhas the advantage of allowing note_selfmask to be used. This is good whena hard hit is followed by several lighter ones on the same cymbal - usingpolyphony, the quieter hits will mute the loud one when the polyphonylimit is reached, which can result in the louder hit’s sustain suddenly and unrealisticallyvanishing. However, this can cause problems with hi-hats where one MIDI note needs totrigger several silence groups as well. This is why Virtuosity Drums has thehi-hat regions set with note_polyphony=MAX, though there might be a better way. Note_polyphony is also separated by keys; while the polyphony limit under agroup can be tracked together for several keys under one group, note_polyphonyis tracked separately for each MIDI note value. The above example modified to use note_polyphony instead of polyphony would looklike this: &lt;group&gt;off_mode=normal//Bow hits&lt;region&gt;key=51 group=30 off_by=33 note_polyphony=5 ampeg_release=0. 3sample=ride_bow_oh. wav&lt;region&gt;key=51 group=40 off_by=43 note_polyphony=5 ampeg_release=0. 4sample=ride_bow_rm. wav//Bell hits&lt;region&gt;key=53 group=31 off_by=33 note_polyphony=4 ampeg_release=0. 3sample=ride_bell_oh. wav&lt;region&gt;key=53 group=41 off_by=43 note_polyphony=4 ampeg_release=0. 4sample=ride_bell_rm. wav//Edge hits (crashes)&lt;region&gt;key=59 group=32 off_by=33 note_polyphony=6 ampeg_release=0. 3sample=ride_edge_oh. wav&lt;region&gt;key=59 group=42 off_by=43 note_polyphony=6 ampeg_release=0. 4sample=ride_edge_rm. wav//Edge chokes&lt;region&gt;key=71 ampeg_attack=0. 15 group=33sample=ride_choke_oh. wav&lt;region&gt;key=71 ampeg_attack=0. 15 group=43sample=ride_choke_rm. wavAnother approach to limiting polyphony: If there is no need have a choke group, it’s possible to limit the polyphony ofa cymbal in a way which is more controllable, by having it self-mute but makingthe fadeout time of the previous samples long. This cannot be done when chokesare required, because chokes need a fast fadeout, but it is another option whichallows how much dense patterns on a cymbal will build up to be controlled with aMIDI CC parameter - the polyphony opcode cannot be modulated by MIDI CC, butampeg_release can. Here is how that might work using CC 100 to modulate the time,with different maximum times for different articulations, as in general edge hitswill build up the most and bell hits the least. Of course, it’s not very possibleto modulate the buildup of a cymbal in the real world, but that doesn’t mean itcan’t be useful in the sampled world. &lt;group&gt;off_mode=normalampeg_release=0. 1//Bow hits&lt;region&gt;key=51 group=30 off_by=30ampeg_release_oncc100=5sample=ride_bow_oh. wav&lt;region&gt;key=51 group=40 off_by=40ampeg_release_oncc100=5. 7sample=ride_bow_rm. wav//Bell hits&lt;region&gt;key=53 group=31 off_by=31ampeg_release_oncc100=3sample=ride_bell_oh. wav&lt;region&gt;key=53 group=41 off_by=41ampeg_release_oncc100=3. 5sample=ride_bell_rm. wav//Edge hits (crashes)&lt;region&gt;key=59 group=32 off_by=32ampeg_release_oncc100=7sample=ride_edge_oh. wav&lt;region&gt;key=59 group=42 off_by=42ampeg_release_oncc100=8sample=ride_edge_rm. wavDeep-sampled hi-hat example: Putting most of the above knowledge together into a complex example can resultin long SFZ files, but the principles themselves remain the same. The mappingfor a deeply sampled hi-hat with tightly closed, closed, loosely closed, quarteropen, half open, open, foot chik, foot splash and pedal return samples, withseparate shank and tip hits for tightly closed, closed, loosely closed andquarter open might look like this: &lt;control&gt;//Key assignments - hi-hat#define $htclstkey 42#define $htchkkey 44#define $htvartkey 46#define $htclsskey 54#define $htsplkey 56#define $htvarskey 58#define $htretkey 68//Hi-hat CC ranges - order for keyboard/sequencing use//E-kit pedal should be backwards#define $ht_lo_hi_init 127#define $ht_cl_lo 0#define $ht_cl_hi 25#define $ht_lc_lo 26#define $ht_lc_hi 51#define $ht_qo_lo 52#define $ht_qo_hi 76#define $ht_ho_lo 77#define $ht_ho_hi 102#define $ht_open_lo 103#define $ht_open_hi 127#define $mg_open_lo 0#define $mg_open_hi 102#define $mg_ho_lo 0#define $mg_ho_hi 76#define $mg_qo_lo 0#define $mg_qo_hi 51#define $mg_lc_lo 0#define $mg_lc_hi 25label_cc4=Hi-hat positionlabel_cc100=Hi-hat closelabel_cc101=Hi-hat OHset_cc4=$ht_lo_hi_initset_cc100=40set_cc101=100&lt;global&gt;

Using #define as a constant with a single value thorughout an instrument workseasily. Defining the same variable to have multiple values at different points in thesame instrument, however, requires care. Using #define to set the same variable todifferent values at one point in the same SFZ file does not work well at least inARIA/Sforzando when loading an instrument. However, a workaround there is touse #include to put each set of #define statements with differentvalues in a separate file.  In simple tests, that has been successful. "

    "title": "Drum basics",
    "body": "SFZ has a lot of opcodes. No instrument uses all of them, though, and even highlycomplicated instruments with thousands of samples will usually only use a dozenor two different opcodes. In this guide, we’ll talk about the opcodes needed to make a simple drum kit. If you have some drum samples, a text editor and an SFZ player, this should beall the knowledge you need to make a working SFZ mapping for those samples. Most of them will apply to most other instrument types as well. Later, we’llapply this knowledge to instruments such as piano, guitar, violin and flute. A very simple instrument to make would be an electronic drum kit with one samplefor each sound. A functional mapping for an entire sampled drum machine usingone-shot samples could be made using only the region header, and two opcodessample and key. With kick, snareand hi-hat samples on their standard General MIDI notes, this could be theentire SFZ file: &lt;region&gt;key=36 sample=kick. wav&lt;region&gt;key=38 sample=snare. wav&lt;region&gt;key=42 sample=closedhat. wavThis would work. Load this into an SFZ player, hit the C on MIDI note 36, andyou get the kick sample playing. However, each sound would play only while anote is held. With drums it’s usually a good idea to play the entire sample, soa very short note will result in a complete drum hit sounding. We can do thatwith the loop_mode opcode, which is also used forlooping (as the name implies), but loop_mode=one_shot causes the sampler toplay the entire sample from start to end, ignoring note off. &lt;region&gt;key=36 loop_mode=one_shot sample=kick. wav&lt;region&gt;key=38 loop_mode=one_shot sample=snare. wav&lt;region&gt;key=42 loop_mode=one_shot sample=closedhat. wavThere’s no need to set the one_shot for each region, though. We can simplifyour life by using the ‹global› header like this: &lt;global&gt;loop_mode=one_shot&lt;region&gt;key=36 sample=kick. wav&lt;region&gt;key=38 sample=snare. wav&lt;region&gt;key=42 sample=closedhat. wavThis is basically all that’s required to take, for example, some ofWave Alchemy’s very nice free samples of TR-808 or Tanzbar drum machines,and make a working SFZ mapping for them. Let’s say what we have isn’t drum machine samples, but acoustic drum samples. These sounds will have natural variation between hits - some depending on hitlocation, a lot depending on dynamics (how hard the drum is hit), and some justplain random. Let’s ignore controlling hit location for now (drum samples mostlydo ignore it), and focus on the other two. Dynamic variation can be captured byrecording hits of various intensity, and organizing them into dynamic layers,also called velocity layers. If we have an acoustic kick drum sampled at four dynamics - quiet, kind of quiet,kind of loud and loud - we have four dynamic layers. Let’s say the files forthese layers are named like this: kick_vl1. wavkick_vl2. wavkick_vl3. wavkick_vl4. wavTo trigger the quiet sample at low MIDI note velocities, we’d use thelovel and hivel opcodes like this: &lt;region&gt;key=36 lovel=0 hivel=31 sample=kick_vl1. wavAll four hits with velocity ranges assigned, evenly splitting the full 0 to 127velocity range into four, would look like this: &lt;region&gt;key=36lovel=0 hivel=31sample=kick_vl1. wav&lt;region&gt;key=36lovel=32 hivel=63sample=kick_vl2. wav&lt;region&gt;key=36lovel=64 hivel=95sample=kick_vl3. wav&lt;region&gt;key=36lovel=96 hivel=127sample=kick_vl4. wavThis can, again, be simplified. The defalut value for lovel is 0, and for hivelit’s 127, so we don’t need to specify setting them to those numbers. Also, wecan use a ‹group› header to make the key opcode the sameacross all four regions: &lt;global&gt;loop_mode=one_shot&lt;group&gt;key=36&lt;region&gt;hivel=31 sample=kick_vl1. wav&lt;region&gt;lovel=32 hivel=63 sample=kick_vl2. wav&lt;region&gt;lovel=64 hivel=95 sample=kick_vl3. wav&lt;region&gt;lovel=96 sample=kick_vl4. wavHowever, the quiet samples will play quieter than they should - because ofstandard velocity tracking, each sample would play at full volume if thevelocity was 127, but we actually need each sample to play at full volume at thevelocity which is equal to its hivel value. This can be done in various ways,and the way we recommend is the amp_velcurve_N opcode, like this: &lt;global&gt;loop_mode=one_shot&lt;group&gt;key=36&lt;region&gt;hivel=31 amp_velcurve_31=1 sample=kick_vl1. wav&lt;region&gt;lovel=32 hivel=63 amp_velcurve_63=1 sample=kick_vl2. wav&lt;region&gt;lovel=64 hivel=95 amp_velcurve_95=1 sample=kick_vl3. wav&lt;region&gt;lovel=96 sample=kick_vl4. wavLet’s say that each dynamic layer also contains four round robins - four sampleswith roughly the same dynamic. This allows us to include some variation, andsound more natural - fast parts won’t sound like a “machine gun”. There are twobasic ways to put round robins to use. One is to use the seq_lengthand seq_position opcodes, like this: &lt;global&gt;loop_mode=one_shot&lt;group&gt;key=36 hivel=31 amp_velcurve_31=1 seq_length=4&lt;region&gt;seq_position=1 sample=kick_vl1_rr1. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=2 sample=kick_vl1_rr2. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=3 sample=kick_vl1_rr3. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=4 sample=kick_vl1_rr4. wav&lt;group&gt;key=36 lovel=32 hivel=63 amp_velcurve_63=1 seq_length=4&lt;region&gt;seq_position=1 sample=kick_vl2_rr1. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=2 sample=kick_vl2_rr2. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=3 sample=kick_vl2_rr3. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=4 sample=kick_vl2_rr4. wav&lt;group&gt;key=36 lovel=64 hivel=95 amp_velcurve_95=1 seq_length=4&lt;region&gt;seq_position=1 sample=kick_vl3_rr1. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=2 sample=kick_vl3_rr2. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=3 sample=kick_vl3_rr3. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=4 sample=kick_vl3_rr4. wav&lt;group&gt;key=36 lovel=96 seq_length=4&lt;region&gt;seq_position=1 sample=kick_vl4_rr1. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=2 sample=kick_vl4_rr2. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=3 sample=kick_vl4_rr3. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=4 sample=kick_vl4_rr4. wavThat’s a kick drum with four dynamic layers and four sequential round robins. As you might have noticed, we’re repeating the key=36 and seq_length=4 opcodesin every group. Those two opcodes could be moved to the global level if all wewanted was a kick drum, but as we’re going to have other instruments with otherkeys and possibly different numbers of round robins, we kept them at the grouplevel. The other way to use round robins is randomized, using thelorand and hirand opcodes. This will make the sampleplayer generate a random number, then play the region whose lorand to hirandrange includes that random number. Whether robins should be used in this randomway or the above sequential way, the answer is “it depends”. It seems that moreinstruments use sequential, though. This is how random round robins would beset up for our kick drum samples: &lt;global&gt;loop_mode=one_shot&lt;group&gt;key=36 hivel=31 amp_velcurve_31=1&lt;region&gt;hirand=0. 25 sample=kick_vl1_rr1. wav&lt;region&gt;lorand=0. 25 hirand=0. 5 sample=kick_vl1_rr2. wav&lt;region&gt;lorand=0. 5 hirand=0. 75 sample=kick_vl1_rr3. wav&lt;region&gt;lorand=0. 75 sample=kick_vl1_rr4. wav&lt;group&gt;key=36 lovel=32 hivel=63 amp_velcurve_63=1&lt;region&gt;hirand=0. 25 sample=kick_vl2_rr1. wav&lt;region&gt;lorand=0. 25 hirand=0. 5 sample=kick_vl2_rr2. wav&lt;region&gt;lorand=0. 5 hirand=0. 75 sample=kick_vl2_rr3. wav&lt;region&gt;lorand=0. 75 sample=kick_vl2_rr4. wav&lt;group&gt;key=36 lovel=64 hivel=95 amp_velcurve_95=1&lt;region&gt;hirand=0. 25 sample=kick_vl3_rr1. wav&lt;region&gt;lorand=0. 25 hirand=0. 5 sample=kick_vl3_rr2. wav&lt;region&gt;lorand=0. 5 hirand=0. 75 sample=kick_vl3_rr3. wav&lt;region&gt;lorand=0. 75 sample=kick_vl3_rr4. wav&lt;group&gt;key=36 lovel=96&lt;region&gt;hirand=0. 25 sample=kick_vl4_rr1. wav&lt;region&gt;lorand=0. 25 hirand=0. 5 sample=kick_vl4_rr2. wav&lt;region&gt;lorand=0. 5 hirand=0. 75 sample=kick_vl4_rr3. wav&lt;region&gt;lorand=0. 75 sample=kick_vl4_rr4. wavIf we go back to sequential round robins and add a snare with onlythree round robins, plus a few comments, the resulting SFZ would look like this: // This is an example of a basic drum kit mapping// All samples set to play in their entirety when a note is received&lt;global&gt;loop_mode=one_shot// This is the kick, on MIDI note 36, with four dynamic layers and four round robins&lt;group&gt;key=36 hivel=31 amp_velcurve_31=1 seq_length=4&lt;region&gt;seq_position=1 sample=kick_vl1_rr1. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=2 sample=kick_vl1_rr2. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=3 sample=kick_vl1_rr3. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=4 sample=kick_vl1_rr4. wav&lt;group&gt;key=36 lovel=32 hivel=63 amp_velcurve_63=1 seq_length=4&lt;region&gt;seq_position=1 sample=kick_vl2_rr1. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=2 sample=kick_vl2_rr2. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=3 sample=kick_vl2_rr3. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=4 sample=kick_vl2_rr4. wav&lt;group&gt;key=36 lovel=64 hivel=95 amp_velcurve_95=1 seq_length=4&lt;region&gt;seq_position=1 sample=kick_vl3_rr1. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=2 sample=kick_vl3_rr2. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=3 sample=kick_vl3_rr3. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=4 sample=kick_vl3_rr4. wav&lt;group&gt;key=36 lovel=96 seq_length=4&lt;region&gt;seq_position=1 sample=kick_vl4_rr1. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=2 sample=kick_vl4_rr2. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=3 sample=kick_vl4_rr3. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=4 sample=kick_vl4_rr4. wav// Here is the snare, on MIDI note 38, with four dynamic layers and three round robins&lt;group&gt;key=38 hivel=31 amp_velcurve_31=1 seq_length=3&lt;region&gt;seq_position=1 sample=snare_vl1_rr1. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=2 sample=snare_vl1_rr2. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=3 sample=snare_vl1_rr3. wav&lt;group&gt;key=38 lovel=32 hivel=63 amp_velcurve_63=1 seq_length=3&lt;region&gt;seq_position=1 sample=snare_vl2_rr1. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=2 sample=snare_vl2_rr2. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=3 sample=snare_vl2_rr3. wav&lt;group&gt;key=38 lovel=64 hivel=95 amp_velcurve_95=1 seq_length=3&lt;region&gt;seq_position=1 sample=snare_vl3_rr1. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=2 sample=snare_vl3_rr2. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=3 sample=snare_vl3_rr3. wav&lt;group&gt;key=38 lovel=96 seq_length=3&lt;region&gt;seq_position=1 sample=snare_vl4_rr1. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=2 sample=snare_vl4_rr2. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=3 sample=snare_vl4_rr3. wavThis is almost all the information needed to map basic drum kits in SFZ.

    "title": "Envelope Generators",
    "body": "Envelope Generator opcodes are part of the Modulation category of opcodes: Traditional (SFZ 1. 0): Traditional envelope generators using ADSR phases can be set using the SFZ 1. 0ampeg (amplitude), pitcheg (pitch) and fileg (filter) opcodes. These opcodes also support additional delay and hold phases. The phases in order are: Delay-Attack-Hold-Decay-Sustain-Release. See belowfor the full list of relevant opcodes. Flex (SFZ 2. 0): With SFZ 2. 0, you can create one or more “flex” envelope generators. Each flex EG is mapped to a destination (amplitude, pitch, etc. )and contains two or more points with a duration and level determined at each point. The duration indicates the amount of time it takes from the previous envelope point to the current. In this way, you can use flex EGs to essentially draw any envelope shape you desire. Here is an example flex EG: eg01_pitch=1200eg01_time1=0 eg01_level1=0eg01_time2=1 eg01_level2=1eg01_time3=2 eg01_level3=0. 5 eg01_sustain=3eg01_time4=1 eg01_level4=0How to interpret the opcodes in the example above:  All of these opcodes begin with “eg01_”, indicating the first flex EGfor the current region. A second flex EG would begin with “eg02_”, and so on.  The first opcode determines that the envelope will affect note pitchto a maximum of 1200 cents (one octave).  Each envelope point is numbered, and these numbers appear at the endof the opcode name (this opcode has four envelope points). There should beboth a “time” and and a “level” opcode specified for each envelope point.  The “time” opcodes indicate time duration in seconds from the previous envelope point.  The “level” opcodes indicate the level percentage at each envelope point(0-1, with “1” meaning “100%”).  The optional “sustain” opcode determines which envelope point will functionas “sustain” in the traditional ADSR model. So here is what happens in the four envelope points in the example:  Note starts at original pitch.  Pitch takes one second to rise 1200 cents (one octave).  Pitch takes two seconds to lower to 50% of 1200 cents. The pitch will remain at this level as long as the note is held.  After releasing the note, the note will take one second to lower to the original pitch. Envelope Curves: SFZ—at least the ARIA Engine and sfizz implementations—uses the following curves for SFZ 1. 0 envelopes(ampeg, pitcheg, fileg, probably others but not tested):  Attack: linear (convex in dB) Decay: convex (linear in dB) Release: convex (linear in dB)ARIA supports changing the shape of each phase curve via opcodessuch as ampeg_attack_shape, fileg_decay_shape, etc. Setting the value for any of these to 0 will result in a linear curve shape,with positive and negative values resulting in concave and convex curves, respectively. Flex EGs (SFZ 2. 0) phases all use a linear curve shape by default,but this can be bent into a logarithmic curve using positive/negative valuesas described in the above paragraph. For example, the following opcodewill set the shape of the first eg01 phase to match the convex curveused in the SFZ 1. 0 ampeg decay/release: eg01_shape2=-10. 36 Note that the shape opcode should be placed on the second point affected by the curve. In other words, eg01_shape2=-10. 36 will affect the curve between envelope points 1 and 2. It is also important to know that ampeg/pitcheg/fileg decay (both SFZ &amp; SF2)behaves differently than flex EG in relation to the sustain level:  ampeg decay: The level in the decay phase descends at the ratedetermined by ampeg_decay but stops once it hits the sustain level. If your decay phase length is 1 second and sustain is 50%,the sustain level is reached after only half a second in the decay phase(assuming linear phase curve).  flex EG phase: The level always scales from starting to ending valueover the full duration of the phase. When emulating an ADSR envelopeusing a flex EG, if your decay phase length is 1 second and sustain is 50%,the volume level won’t reach 50% until the end of that one second. If trying to match a SoundFont instrument’s logarithmic curves,set the phase’s shape to 6 (concave) or -6 (convex). This is only an approximation, as the curve is not identical. If you wish to use a flex EG to replace the SFZ 1. 0 ampeg,set the destination as eg01_ampeg=100 rather than eg01_amplitude=100. This will disable the SFZ 1. 0 ampeg and allow the flex EG to provide a release phase. SFZ 1 EG Opcodes: The 3 EG destinations in the SFZ 1 standard are: ampeg (amplitude),fileg (filter) and pitcheg (pitch). The EG destinations are represented by (eg type) in the below list - soampeg_attack would be the amplitude envelope attack, pitcheg_sustain would bethe pitch envelope sustain level etc. These are 6-points Delay-Attack-Hold-Decay-Sustain-Release.

    "title": "Envelope Generators",
    "body": "Envelope generators (EGs) are used to control the profile of the volume, filter, pitch, or other parameter, based on the timing of the key press and release(including sustain / sostenuto pedal release. ) These are often called “ADSRs”,after the four parameters (Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release) that were usedto control envelopes in early synthesizers (and many current ones as well. ) See SFZ1 Modulations to see examples of how these can be applied. SFZ has two types of EGs: SFZ1 and SFZ2. SFZ1: DSAHDSR: SFZ1 envelopes are sometimes called DSAHDSR after the 7 controls of the envelope,which are applied in the order given below. An EG can control a variety of parameters,but to help understand, you can imagine it controlling the volume, in which case youcan substitute “volume” for “EG” below.       Parameter   Suffix   Description         Delay time (s)   _delay   time to wait after key is depressed until the EG starts       Start level (%)   _start   level at which to start       Attack time (s)   _attack   time from note start (at start level) to 100% level       Hold time (s)   _hold   time the volume is held at 100% level       Decay time1 (s)   _decay   time2 for the volume to decrease from 100% to the sustain level       Sustain level (%)   _sustain   the % level at which the EG remains while the key is down or the sustain pedal is down       Release time3   _release   time2 for the EG to decrease to zero. This begins when both key and sustain pedal are released, even if the prior stages have not completed.    Here is a screenshot of an audio file created using Sforzando,showing the ampeg envelope shape and its stages. Note that this image assumes the Start level is 0. If it were nonzero, the tip of the left-pointing arrow would look chopped off vertically.  Here’s a play-by-play explanation, when using the EG for volume (ampeg_xxx). When the key is depressed, Delay time elapses and then the note starts(at Start level, which above is the default of 0. )The volume increases (at a constant dB/sec rate) for the Attack time and thenreaches the peak level for that note(which is controlled by the velocity and possibly other parameters. )The volume stays at that level for the Hold time, after which it falls offfor the Decay time until it reaches the Sustain level. It remains at that level until the key and sustain pedal are both released,when it takes the Release time to fall off to silence. Note that when using an envelope generator to control volume,it is usually not necessary to adjust release or decay times based on velocity:that will happen naturally. That is, if I configure ampeg_release=1and play a very loud note, that note will decay with a rateso that one second later it will be about 90 dB quieter than when it started. If I play a very soft note, that note will also decay with the same rate,so that 1 second later it will be 90 dB quieter when it started. That’s pretty close to how most natural instruments behave. Another note when using an envelope to control volume:if you’re playing a sample that already has a natural envelope,such as the pluck of a harp string, you normally don’t have to configurethe envelope because it’s already in the sample,which has a natural attack and decay. However, you’ll still probably want to configure a release,so that if the key is released before the sample is finished,it doesn’t end abruptly. With most natural instruments,this release rate varies with pitch, but not velocity. SFZ2: The SFZ2 standard has a more flexible generator that can be used in addition tothe above. This is briefly described in SFZ2 Modulations:Envelopes. References:       Decay time is actually a constant decay rate that is specified as the time for the EG to go from 100% to 0%.  However, this can be changed by setting xxx_decay_zero=0 to instead mean to decay from 100% to sustain level in the given time, from the actual sustain level.  &#8617;        When using an amp envelope generator, “0%” means “silence” but it’s actually interpreted as -90dBFS for Aria, or -80dBFS for original sfz.  This adjustment is needed because volume is contolled in dB, and silence in dB is negative infinity, which complicates the math.  &#8617; &#8617;2        Release time is actually a constant decay rate that is specified as the time for the EG to go from the sustain level to zero.  However, this can be changed setting by xxx_release_zero=1 to instead mean to decay from 100% to zero in the given time.  &#8617;    "

    "title": "Epic Drums",
    "body": "Basic Concept: Epic percussion in media music is commonly created by recording large ensembles of large, low-tuned drums (for example taikos) in large, naturally reverberant spaces. The Virtuosity Drums kit includes an “Epic” knob which makes the small, high-tuned jazz kit recorded in a music store sound surprisingly, well, epic. This tutorial explains how that trick works. Using drum samples at pitches lower than the original recording makes them sound bigger in several ways. One, obviously, the pitch is lower. Two, slowing down the playbackalso slows down attack times and lengthens decay tails. This includes any reverb tails captured by the microphones, which means pitching a sound down makes it sound as ifit was recorded in a larger space. However, pitching sounds down also takes away the high end and reduces definition. Playing a sound at both its original pitch and tuned down an octave is a way to get both at the same time - a large, deep sound with reverb tails twice the length of thereal recording, and the clarity and definition of the originally pitched sample. This could be done using the tune opcode, though transpose is likelymore convenient. Here is a very simple example using a single floor tom sample: &lt;region&gt;sample=Rack_Tom. wav&lt;region&gt;transpose=-12sample=Rack_Tom. wavIf the sample maps are modularized using #include statements,it becomes very simple to set up a volume control, and also use locc so thatthe transposed samples don’t use up polyphony voices when their volume is at zero. &lt;master&gt;amplitude_oncc101=100locc101=1#include  sample_maps/rack_tom. sfz &lt;master&gt;amplitude_oncc102=100locc102=1transpose=-12#include  sample_maps/rack_tom. sfz Some Pitfalls: This does not work as well with close mics, which don’t have much room reverb in the recording. This is why in Virtuosity Drums, the kick and snare mics aren’t used withthe Epic control.  With kicks and other low drums, there’s also a point of diminishing returns with having a lot of low frequencies, which is one more reason to not applythis to kick close mics. Although sample maps can often be reused, as in the above example, instruments which have self-muting behavior, such as hi-hats, or instruments with polyphony limitationswill need separate polyphony group numbers for the transposed regions, just as if the transposed regions were separate microphone positions. With complex muting scenarios this will result in very large numbers of groups which can be difficult to keep track of, but with simple self-muting it could look like this: &lt;master&gt;amplitude_oncc101=100locc101=1group=1off_by=1#include  sample_maps/hi_hat. sfz &lt;master&gt;amplitude_oncc102=100locc102=1group=11off_by=11transpose=-12#include  sample_maps/hi_hat. sfz If the samples include any preroll before the hit, which more distant microphone samples naturally will, transposing down an octave will double the length of that preroll. This is usually not a problem, but in extreme cases it may be necessary to use offsetto reduce the preroll to avoid a flam sound. In Virtuosity Drums, this is done for the hi-hat pedal articulations. On the topic of flams, this does not work well with flams, buzz rolls and other sounds which do not consist of a single distinct hit. Long rolls and partiallyclosed hi-hats seem to work fairly well, however. Tambourines, shakers etc. will usually sound quite unnatural with the transposed and untransposed sound appearing as separate entities, but sometimes this can be musically useful. Other Uses: Applying this trick to a snare bottom mic usually results in a sound which is not epic, but can be very industrial. Beyond drums, this could work reasonably well with other instruments. Sounds with fast, distinct attacks will behave more similarly to drums, though at least on principle this could be used with sounds such as sustained bowed strings also. Of course, pitched instruments can be doubled with another note an octave lower without transposition, as long as the lower note also falls in their range. However, transposition an octave down does make the reverb tails twice as long. "

ARIA adds three more possible values for both opcodes. Examples: fil_type=lpf_2pfil_type=hpf_1pPassive tone controls in guitars are one-pole low pass filters. Typical subtractive synthesizer filters are two-pole filters. fil2_type=hpf_2pThe combination of fil and fil2 can be used to have, forexample, both a high-pass and a low-pass filter, like this. In the below example, the first filter does not have a typeset explicitly, so fil_type defaults to lpf_2p, making ita lowpass filter. The second filter is set to be a highpass filter. cutoff=1200resonance=6fil2_type=hpf_2pcutoff2=250resonance2=3Players support: Both ARIA and LinuxSampler supports all SFZ v1 filter types. The following table describes which SFZ v2 and ARIA extension filter types they support. lsh, hsh and peq are ARIA extensions, allowing filters to be used as low-shelf,high-shelf or up to two additional parametric EQ bands,in addition to the default three eqN bands. Filters of these three types use fil_gain or fil2_gainto set the gain of the shelf or band.

Examples: group=3group=334The group opcode is used together with off_by to make something monophonic. For example, the flute is by nature a monophonic instrument, so if a flute wererecorded with one microphone and had one set of samples, it would make sense toset all its samples to have one group. A guitar is polyphonic, but each stringis monophonic, so a six-string guitar would naturally be split into six groups -one per string. In these cases, the group number will be equal to the off_bynumber. This is also commonly used with hi-hats - this is an example of where things canget more sophisticated with a large number of groups involved, as it’s possibleto set more closed hi-hat sounds mute more open ones, but not vice-versa, and it’salso quite possible that there are separate close mic, overhead and room samples. group and off_by can also be used in other contexts where one soundshould cause another to stop but enforcing monophony is not the goal - for example,a crash cymbal doesn’t need to be monophonic, as allowing the sound to build upis reasonably natural, but if we wanted to implement a cymbal choke, then thecrash sounds would be in one group, the choke samples in another. Practical Considerations: The actual minimum and maximum values are not currently known. Some playerswill treat numbers outside a certain range as equivalent to group=0, andARIA/Sforzando will also do this with text strings. The behavior ofnon-integer numbers is also currently unknown. This makes it possible to usean extremely large number for one group, but it’s obviously not recommended. "

Also in ARIA, a separate random number is generated for each region which is playing,which means lorand/hirand probably should not be used with samples which havemultiple mic positions. Using it can result in triggering spot, overhead and roommics which do not match, and that can result in phasing issues etc. There are other potential uses which have nothing to do with round robins, forexample having key fingering noises on a clarinet trigger sometimes(but not always) when a note is played.

These opcodes will often need to be used with amp_velcurve_N, unlessamp_veltrack is set to 0. The reason for this is that with defaultvelocity tracking behavior and non-normalized samples (and there are many reasonswhy normalizing samples should be avoided), the quiet velocity layers will be too quiet. Velocity 0 is a note-off message, so 1 is the lowest usable value with hivel/lovel. Example: lovel=64 hivel=95An instrument with four velocity-controlled dynamic layers might use lovel andhivel like this: &lt;region&gt;hivel=31 amp_velcurve_31=1 sample=kick_vl1. wav&lt;region&gt;lovel=32 hivel=63 amp_velcurve_63=1 sample=kick_vl2. wav&lt;region&gt;lovel=64 hivel=95 amp_velcurve_95=1 sample=kick_vl3. wav&lt;region&gt;lovel=96 sample=kick_vl4. wavThe way this would work is the kick_vl1. wav region will play at velocities upto 31, with volume going gradually from 0 at velocity 0 (so, no sound) to fullvolume at velocity 31. The kick_vl2. wav region will play at velocties 32 to 63,with volume being full at velocity 63 and lower volume (but not zero) at 32. The kick_vl3 wav region will play at velocites 64 to 95, with full volume atvelocity 95. Finally, the kick_vl4 layer plays at velocities 96 to 127, with noamp_velcurve_N set meaning it will have full volume at velocity 127. "

    "body": "The file to which #include points is, in effect,pasted into the SFZ file at the point of the #include. This means thatthe file structure needs to be respected - after all #includes are processed,‹control› header needs to be before the regions in the file,‹curve› opcodes need to be at the bottom etc. This can benested - #included files can contain more #includes of their own,though of course recursion must be avoided! The included path must be surrounded by double quotes, similar to how includeworks in C/C++ files. Note that this is different from how the paths in thesample opcode works, which do not need quotes. Either a filename or a path can be used. If the #included files are in anotherfolder, the SFZ is interpreted as if it was in the main SFZ file’s path, not thepath where the #included files are. The #included files can either have theextension sfz or sfzh, which is functionally no different from sfz, just usedfor clarity when #including a header. This is useful for creating large complex files, and also for simplifying themanagement of files which repeat similar regions with different opcodes. This isespecially convenient in conjunction with the ‹master› header. Examples: #include  header. sfz #include  note_map. sfz #include  legato/dynfade_legato_first_map. sfz Here’s an example of how #include and master can be used together: &lt;global&gt;loop_mode=one_shotoff_mode=normaltune=-1200 //Everything is tuned down an octave, then tuned back up with its own tune parampan=-100 //Similar for pan - hard left, brought to proper position with parampan_oncc10=0 //Disable master panamplitude_oncc7=100ampeg_attack=0. 001ampeg_decay=0. 7ampeg_sustain=100&lt;master&gt;amplitude_cc30=100pan_cc31=200tune_cc32=2400tune_cc55=-500offset_cc33=3000ampeg_sustain_oncc33=-100#include  mappings/bobobo_bass. sfz &lt;master&gt;amplitude_cc35=100pan_cc36=200tune_cc37=2400offset_cc38=1500ampeg_sustain_oncc38=-100tune_cc55=-250#include  mappings/bobobo_tenor_l_1. sfz #include  mappings/bobobo_tenor_l_2. sfz Using #include with #define in the same instrument requires care,especially if the same value has to be #defined to have different settings atdifferent points in an instrument. Using #define to set the same variable to differentvalues at one point in the same SFZ file does not work well at least in ARIA/Sforzandowhen loading an instrument. However, a workaround there is to use #include to put each#define statement in a separate file. In simple tests, that has been successful. "

As a solution, ARIA and possibly other SFZ2 players allow either _ccN, _onccNor ccN (with no underscore) to be used for many modulations,and interpret all of those the same. However, these aliases are not part ofeither the SFZ1 and SFZ2 standard, and for maximum compatibility,it is best to use the standard syntax.

    "body": "Welcome to SFZFormat. com!:  This is the main reference point for anyone who wants to create virtual musicalinstruments using the SFZ format.  The SFZ format is a file format to define how a collection of samples arearranged for performance. The goal behind the SFZ format is to provide a free,simple, minimalistic and expandable format to arrange, distribute and use audiosamples with the highest possible quality and the highest possible performanceflexibility. Soundware, software and hardware developers can create, use anddistribute the SFZ format files for free, for either free or commercial applications. What SFZ is not: To clarify, the term SFZ as used on this site does not mean a sforzando dynamic marking,and it also is not the same thing as a soundfont. Soundfonts are a completely differentfile format which includes both the samples and the definitions of sample behavior in thesame binary file, while SFZ is a file format which only defines the behavior of musicalinstruments and does not include the sample content. SF2 may look a bit like SFZ visually,but that’s a coincidence. Features:  A . sfz definition file is just a text file. Consequently,it can be created by using any text editor.  Samples of any bit depth (8/16/24/32-bit)and sample rate (44. 1 kHz, 48 kHz, 384 kHz etc. ), mono or stereo.  Compressed and uncompressed sample formats can both be used within the same instrument.  Loops embedded in sample files or configured in the SFZ.  Velocity layers, round robins, keyboard splits and layers.  Sample playback based on MIDI controllers (note on, note off,continuous controllers, pitch bend, channel - and polyphonic aftertouch,keyboard switches) and internal generators (random, sequence counters).  Unidirectional and bidirectional exclusive regions (mute groups).  Release trigger regions with release trigger attenuation control.  Crossfade layer controls.  Ability to distinguish legato notes from first notes.  Envelope and LFO modulation sources with possible targets including volume,pitch, filter cutoff and more. Requirements: To make use of the SFZ format requires three things:  Samples SFZ player SFZ filewhich tells the player how to use the samples. The SFZ file itself can be createdusing any text editor, though for more complex cases with hundreds or thousandsof samples, additional tools can make this easier - some people use spreadsheets,and there are also dedicated SFZ creation tools. Here’s a basic SFZ file you can copy to start your own. Making Instruments: Text guides on how to make a simple instrument, covering the essential opcodes    Drum basics - covers global, group andregion headers, sample, key, lovel / hivel, amp_velcurve_N,seq_length, seq_position and lorand / hirand.     Sustained note basics - using a fluteas an example. Adds lokey / hikey, pitch_keycenter, xfin / xfout, locc / hicc,keyswitching, group, off_by and off_mode.  Some more advanced topics    Vibrato - typical string vibrato, humanized vibrato,asymmetrical vibrato, and even filter wobble.     Legato - simulated legato and portamento as well astrue sampled legato.     Cymbal muting - using group, off_by, off_modeand polyphony to make hi-hat and cymbal notes mute previous notesin a musically useful way.     Brush stirs - two different approaches to brushed drum techniques which produce a continuous sound rather than a hit.  "

That means most chromatically sampled instruments or drum kits. key values can be specified in MIDI note numbers (0-127) or note names(IPN Standard). Numbers generally are better to use for getting the SFZ tobehave the same in all DAWs. Example: These two conventions will yield the same key mapping: key=72orkey=c5Both are also equivalent to: lokey=72 hikey=72 pitch_keycenter=72Key can also be combined with the others, which will override the value set by keyalthough key should be specified first. In ARIA, the value set by pitch_keycenterwill always be used, whether key or pitch_keycenter is set first in the SFZ file. However, in some other players, setting pitch_keycenter to a different value than keyis only effective if key is set first and pitch_keycenter second. Therefore, forcompatibility, it is best to set key first, and pitch_keycenter later. key=72 lokey=70Will be equivalent to lokey=70 hikey=72 pitch_keycenter=72However, this would just be the same as setting key=72, as key comes later andthe lokey value it would set will override the previous lokey. lokey=70 key=72"

This is a starting point for implementing legato. If only group and off_by are specified, the resulting sound will probably be quite bad, asthis will use default values for off_mode, ampeg_attack and ampeg_release. This means the note beingmuted will drop off extremely quickly, which will probably leave an audible drop in levels during thetransition, unless the next note has an extremely fast attack. Therefore, at least ampeg_releasewill need to be specified in most cases - though most instruments will need to specify that evenif not using legato. &lt;global&gt;ampeg_release=0. 3 amp_veltrack=0 sw_lokey=48 sw_hikey=49group=1 off_by=1 off_mode=normal&lt;group&gt;lokey=50 hikey=51 pitch_keycenter=50 sw_last=48&lt;region&gt;sample=d4_p. wav xfin_locc1=0 xfin_hicc1=42 xfout_locc1=43 xfout_hicc1=85&lt;region&gt;sample=d4_mf. wav xfin_locc1=43 xfin_hicc1=85 xfout_locc1=86 xfout_hicc1=127&lt;region&gt;sample=d4_f. wav xfin_locc1=86 xfin_hicc1=127&lt;group&gt;lokey=52 hikey=53 pitch_keycenter=52 sw_last=48&lt;region&gt;sample=e4_p. wav xfin_locc1=0 xfin_hicc1=42 xfout_locc1=43 xfout_hicc1=85&lt;region&gt;sample=e4_mf. wav xfin_locc1=43 xfin_hicc1=85 xfout_locc1=86 xfout_hicc1=127&lt;region&gt;sample=e4_f. wav xfin_locc1=86 xfin_hicc1=127&lt;group&gt;lokey=50 hikey=51 pitch_keycenter=50 sw_last=49&lt;region&gt;sample=d4_ft_p. wav xfin_locc1=0 xfin_hicc1=63 xfout_locc1=64 xfout_hicc1=127&lt;region&gt;sample=d4_ft_f. wav xfin_locc1=64 xfin_hicc1=127&lt;group&gt;lokey=52 hikey=53 pitch_keycenter=52 sw_last=49&lt;region&gt;sample=e4_ft_p. wav xfin_locc1=0 xfin_hicc1=63 xfout_locc1=64 xfout_hicc1=127&lt;region&gt;sample=e4_ft_f. wav xfin_locc1=64 xfin_hicc1=127Legato regions: The above will allow only one note to sound at a time, with a quick crossfade betweenthe old and new note. In many cases, though, it makes sense to treat the legato notesdifferently than the notes which start a phrase when no other note is playing. The[trigger] opcode is used to separate regions into initial and legato. Forsustained sounds, it can make sense to use the [offset] opcode to skip the startof the sample for legato regions. It’s also probably a good idea to use offset_attackin these cases, which both makes the transition sound smoother and avoids clicks andpops in cases where the offset does not fall on a zero crossing. Here are the relevantopcodes from the Hadziha choir. An offset of 6000 samples is enough to skip the fraction of a second when the singersare starting the note, but not enough to skip the part of the sample when they’re stillsettling on a common pitch, so it works well for this particular choir. The crossfadetimes with an off time of 1 second and legato note attack time of 0. 4 seconds areprobably much longer than would be needed for most solo instruments or voices, orensembles intended for fast legato, but could be a good range for other types ofensembles playing slowly. Note that the samples are not all in the same group - the initial note regions are inpolyphony group 1, which is muted by group 2. The legato regions are in polyphonygroup 2, which mutes itself. Having everything in group 1 should also work, though. This was done this was to allow the use of additional syllable start samples, whichwould then be group 3 and also be muted by group 2. As with hi-hat muting, if thereare multiple mic positions in separate files, each mic position will need its ownpolyphony groups. &lt;global&gt;off_mode=timeoff_time=1amp_veltrack=0&lt;master&gt;trigger=firstgroup=1off_by=2//Sample map goes here#include  mappings/6_a_map. sfz &lt;master&gt;trigger=legatooffset=6000ampeg_attack=0. 4group=2off_by=2//Sample map goes here#include  mappings/6_a_map. sfz As this does not use velocity to control note volume, that frees up velocity forsomething else, so in this specific case velocity is repurposed to shorten theattack time on the legato notes, which makes the patch more intuitively playable. &lt;global&gt;off_mode=timeoff_time=1amp_veltrack=0&lt;master&gt;trigger=firstgroup=1off_by=3//Sample map goes here#include  mappings/6_a_map. sfz &lt;master&gt;trigger=legatooffset=6000ampeg_attack=1ampeg_vel2attack=-0. 8group=3off_by=3//Sample map goes here#include  mappings/6_a_map. sfz Portamento: Another possibility is portamento, or having a pitch glide implemented on thelegato regions. Here are the relevant opcodes from Karoryfer SamplesMeatbass, which has both legato and portamento. The portamento isvery obviously fake for slow glides across long intervals, but as long as theinterval is no more than a third or fourth, it can be convincing. Of course, thenarrower the interval and the shorter the time, the easier it is to soundconvincing. With the portamento time at zero, this is effectively the same asnon-portamento legato in the above example. In the below setup, MIDI CC109 controls the glide time and an SFZ2 [envelope]is used to make the pitch change happen. CC140 is the ARIA extension CC for pitchdelta, and being the difference in pitch between the previous note and thecurrent note, it sets the depth of the glide envelope. &lt;global&gt;eg06_sustain=1 //Pitch envelope setup for legato slideseg06_level0=-1 //Envelope starts away from the note pitcheg06_time0=0eg06_pitch_oncc140=100 //This is the pitch deptheg06_time1=0eg06_level1=0 //At the end of the envelope, return to base pitch//eg06_time1_oncc109 needs to be set for the legato regions - but we don't want//it on for all regions so the default is 0//At zero envelope duration the pitch goes to base pitch immediately so there//is no glide//Typical stuff for monophonic instrumentsoff_mode=normalampeg_release_oncc104=2All the sample regions are then basically duplicated in non-legato and legatoversions. Here’s an example non-legato region with triggerset to first and no eg06_time_oncc109 set. The group and off_by work just likein the above examples. &lt;group&gt;trigger=firstoff_mode=normalgroup=1off_by=1&lt;region&gt;sample=. . \Samples\arco_looped\c4_sustain. wavpitch_keycenter=48And the corresponding legato region with trigger set to legato, the eg06 glideenvelope time control, and also an attack time, to let the note fade inmore gradually, with this controlled by CC100 rather than velocity, as theexample above. This is another option. &lt;group&gt;trigger=legatooff_mode=normalgroup=1off_by=1eg06_time1_oncc109=0. 3ampeg_attack_oncc100=0. 5&lt;region&gt;sample=. . \Samples\arco_looped\c4_sustain. wavpitch_keycenter=48True sampled legato: Here are examples from a simple flute test by MatFluor. The trigger=first regionswork similarly as all the above examples, and the [sw_previous] opcode can be usedto choose which sample plays for the legato regions. If the samples would includeboth the legato transition and the complete sustain of the following note, thingswould be very simple: &lt;group&gt;// Legato transitions and the complete sustain of the next note both in the same sampletrigger=legatogroup=2off_by=1ampeg_attack=0. 05 ampeg_release=0. 2off_mode=normal// Leg transitions up&lt;region&gt; sample=legatovib_g4_a4. wav key=A4 sw_previous=G4&lt;region&gt; sample=legatovib_g4_c5. wav key=C5 sw_previous=G4&lt;region&gt; sample=legatovib_a4_c5. wav key=C5 sw_previous=A4// Leg transitions down&lt;region&gt; sample=legatovib_c5_a4. wav key=A4 sw_previous=C5&lt;region&gt; sample=legatovib_c5_g4. wav key=G4 sw_previous=C5Recording the full sustain after every transition adds greatly to the recordingtime, diskspace and RAM use, however. It may be necessary in some cases, such assolo vocals, but in other cases it’s possible to use transition samples whichare short, then fade in the regular sustain sample. &lt;group&gt;// Legato transitions in one sample, crossfaded into standard sustain in another sampletrigger=legatogroup=2off_by=1ampeg_attack=0. 05 ampeg_release=0. 2off_mode=normal// Leg transitions up&lt;region&gt; sample=legatovib_g4_a4. wav key=A4 sw_previous=G4 ampeg_hold=0. 25 ampeg_decay=0. 2 ampeg_sustain=0 offset=45000 ampeg_decay_shape=-1. 4&lt;region&gt; sample=legatovib_g4_c5. wav key=C5 sw_previous=G4 ampeg_hold=0. 25 ampeg_decay=0. 2 ampeg_sustain=0 offset=45000 ampeg_decay_shape=-1. 4&lt;region&gt; sample=legatovib_a4_c5. wav key=C5 sw_previous=A4 ampeg_hold=0. 25 ampeg_decay=0. 2 ampeg_sustain=0 offset=45000 ampeg_decay_shape=-1. 4// Leg transitions down&lt;region&gt; sample=legatovib_c5_a4. wav key=A4 sw_previous=C5 ampeg_hold=0. 25 ampeg_decay=0. 2 ampeg_sustain=0 offset=45000 ampeg_decay_shape=-1. 4&lt;region&gt; sample=legatovib_c5_g4. wav key=G4 sw_previous=C5 ampeg_hold=0. 25 ampeg_decay=0. 2 ampeg_sustain=0 offset=45000 ampeg_decay_shape=-1. 4&lt;region&gt; sample=legatovib_a4_g4. wav key=G4 sw_previous=A4 ampeg_hold=0. 25 ampeg_decay=0. 2 ampeg_sustain=0 offset=43000 ampeg_decay_shape=-1. 4// Leg sustains&lt;region&gt; sample=sustainvib_c5. wav key=C5 ampeg_attack=0. 3 offset=5000 ampeg_attack_shape=3. 8&lt;region&gt; sample=sustainvib_a4. wav key=A4 ampeg_attack=0. 3 offset=5000 ampeg_attack_shape=3. 8&lt;region&gt; sample=sustainvib_g4. wav key=G4 ampeg_attack=0. 3 offset=5000 ampeg_attack_shape=3. 8Another consideration is that for instruments with a wide range, it may not be worthwhileto record every possible transition, and only record transitions of up to one octave, forexample. The [extended CCs] do not always behave quite like other CCs,necessitating using hdcc in ARIA, but the below works for a legato vocal with a range ofless than two octaves. &lt;global&gt;off_mode=timeoff_time=0. 4ampeg_release=0. 3&lt;group&gt;trigger=firstgroup=1off_by=1#include  modules/vowel_sustain_a. sfz &lt;group&gt;trigger=legatogroup=1off_by=1ampeg_attack=0. 1ampeg_hold=0. 3ampeg_decay=0. 6ampeg_sustain=0hihdcc141=12. 1#include  modules/vowel_transition_a. sfz &lt;group&gt;trigger=legatogroup=2off_by=1delay=0. 3ampeg_attack=0. 2offset=40000hihdcc141=12. 1#include  modules/vowel_sustain_a. sfz &lt;group&gt;trigger=legatogroup=1off_by=1ampeg_attack=0. 1lohdcc141=12. 9hihdcc141=24offset=12000#include  modules/vowel_sustain_a. sfz It would also be possible to use CC 140 in a similar way in an instrument which,for example, had legato transitions recorded ascending but not descending.

    "title": "LFO",
    "body": "LFO (Low Frequency Oscillator) opcodes are part of the [Modulation]category of opcodes. They are used to create effects such as pitch vibrato(when modulating pitch), tremolo (when modulating volume) and filter wobble(when modulating filter cutoff) LFOs are triggered by note-on events for the specified region, which means thereare no free-running LFOs in the SFZ spec. If a free-running LFO is needed, forexample to apply one slow pitch vibrato wave to a series of rapidly plucked oudnotes, that will need to use an external modulation source outside theSFZ player - in other words, perhaps in a DAW that the SFZ player is being usedin as a plugin. SFZ 1 LFOs: 3 LFO destinations in SFZ 1 standard:  amplfo (amplitude) fillfo (filter) pitchlfo (pitch)[Here’s a very simple example of a pitch LFO integration][1]  [(lfo type)_delay] [(lfo type)_fade] [(lfo type)_freq] [(lfo type)_freqccX] [(lfo type)_depth] [(lfo type)_depthccX] [(lfo type)_depthchanaft] [(lfo type)_depthpolyaft] [(lfo type)_freqchanaft] [(lfo type)_freqpolyaft]Assignable LFOs (SFZ 2): Much like the Flex EG, these newer LFO can target almost any tone-defining parameter: [Here’s a very simple example of an sfz 2 lfo integration, targeted to pitch][1]  [lfoN_wave] [lfoN_freq] [lfoN_freq_onccX] [lfoN_freq_smoothccX] [lfoN_freq_stepccX] [lfoN_delay] [lfoN_delay_onccX] [lfoN_fade] [lfoN_fade_onccX] [lfoN_phase] [lfoN_phase_onccX] [lfoN_count]Assignable LFO Destinations: These destinations are added as a suffix to ‘lfoN_’. For example,lfo01_pitch=100 makes LFO 01 affect pitch with a max depth of 100 cents, andlfo03_freq_lfo01=1. 3 would make LFO 03 add up to 1. 3 Hertz to thefrequency of LFO 01. Note that it’s possible to create modulation feedbackloops this way, for example LFO 01 modulating LFO 02 while LFO 02 modulatesLFO 01. In addition to the below, in ARIA it’s possible to control the amountof freq_lfo with MIDI CC, so lfo03_freq_lfo01_oncc117=1. 3 would make LFO 03 addup to 1. 3 Hertz to the frequency of LFO 01, with the amount modulated by MIDICC 117. So, freq_lfo_oncc would be added to the below list for ARIA, thoughdepth_lfo_oncc and depthadd_lfo_oncc do not appear to be available.  freq_lfoX depth_lfoX depthadd_lfoX pitch pitch_oncc pitch_smoothcc pitch_stepcc decim decim_oncc decim_smoothcc decim_stepcc bitred bitred_oncc bitred_smoothcc bitred_stepcc cutoff cutoff_oncc cutoff_smoothcc cutoff_stepcc resonance resonance_oncc resonance_smoothcc resonance_stepcc cutoff2 cutoff2_oncc cutoff2_smoothcc cutoff2_stepcc resonance2 resonance2_oncc resonance2_smoothcc resonance2_stepcc eqNfreq eqNfreq_oncc eqNfreq_smoothcc eqNfreq_stepcc eqNbw eqNbw_oncc eqNbw_smoothcc eqNbw_stepcc eqNgain eqNgain_oncc eqNgain_smoothcc eqNgain_stepcc volume volume_oncc volume_smoothcc volume_stepcc amplitude amplitude_oncc amplitude_smoothcc amplitude_stepcc pan pan_oncc pan_smoothcc pan_stepcc width width_oncc width_smoothcc width_stepccPractical Considerations: SFZ allows LFOs to modulate the frequency of other LFOs, including feedback(LFO number M modulating LFO number N, and vice versa). Mathematically, thiscan cause very chaotic results. However, in the Cakewalk products (and possiblyalso in ARIA, though this is not checked) this is simplified. If the number of themodulating LFO is lower than the LFO being modulated (for example, LFO1 modulatesLFO2), the modulation is applied when it is calculated. However, if the numberof the modulating LFO is higher than the LFO being modulated (for example, LFO4modulating LFO2), the modulation is not applied until the next LFO frequencyupdate cycle. This both keeps LFO feedback controlled, and reduces the CPU needed to calculateLFO modulations.

A simpler example would be switching betweensine, saw and noise waveforms: &lt;region&gt;hicc1=63 sample=*sine&lt;region&gt;locc1=64 hicc=126 sample=*saw&lt;region&gt;locc1=127 sample=*noiseThis is a “hard” switch - if a region is within the locc to hicc range it plays,if it’s outside that range it does not play. For smooth fades controlled by CC(such as crossfaded dynamic layers or crossfaded vibrato layers on sustainedinstruments), other opcodes such as xfin_loccN / xfin_hiccNand xfout_loccN / xfout_hiccN should be used, or perhapsthe amplitude_onccN ARIA extension.

That is, the playerwill play the sample looped using the first defined loop, if available. If noloops are defined (which is usually the case with most files), the wave willplay unlooped. The possible values are:    no_loop: no looping will be performed. Sample will play straight from start       to end, or until note off, whatever reaches first.     one_shot: sample will play from start to end, ignoring note off.        This is commonly used for drums.        This mode is engaged automatically if the count opcode is defined.     loop_continuous: once the player reaches sample loop point,           the loop will play until note expiration.           This includes looping during the release phase.     loop_sustain: the player will play the loop while the note is held,         by keeping it depressed or by using the sustain pedal (CC64).          During the release phase, there’s no looping.  Whether no_loop, loop_continuous or loop_sustain is set, the durationof the release phase is set using ampeg_release. However, in loop_sustainor no_loop mode, the sound can be cut off before the release phase ends,if the end of sample is reached. In loop_continuous mode, the loop will repeatif the loop end is reached during the release phase, including repeatingmultiple times if the release time is longer than the loop length. Practical Considerations: For samples with trigger=release set, no_loop and one_shot will both behaveas one_shot and the entire release sample will play. If loop_continuous is set,looping will be applied - and unless loop_count is set or there is some other waythe sound will be muted, that means the sound can potentially continue indefinitely. If an instrument is using the default loop_mode=no_loop, there is no need to setloop_mode=one_shot for the release samples; however, if an instrument hasloop_mode=loop_continuous set under a header which also includes release samples,the release regions will normally need to be set to loop_mode=one_shot to override that.

That is, the playerwill play the sample looped using the first defined loop, if available. If noloops are defined (which is usually the case with most files), the wave willplay unlooped. The possible values are:    no_loop: no looping will be performed. Sample will play straight from start       to end, or until note off, whatever reaches first.     one_shot: sample will play from start to end, ignoring note off.        This is commonly used for drums.        This mode is engaged automatically if the count opcode is defined.     loop_continuous: once the player reaches sample loop point,           the loop will play until note expiration.           This includes looping during the release phase.     loop_sustain: the player will play the loop while the note is held,         by keeping it depressed or by using the sustain pedal (CC64).          During the release phase, there’s no looping.  Whether no_loop, loop_continuous or loop_sustain is set, the durationof the release phase is set using ampeg_release. However, in loop_sustainor no_loop mode, the sound can be cut off before the release phase ends,if the end of sample is reached. In loop_continuous mode, the loop will repeatif the loop end is reached during the release phase, including repeatingmultiple times if the release time is longer than the loop length. Practical Considerations: For samples with trigger=release set, no_loop and one_shot will both behaveas one_shot and the entire release sample will play. If loop_continuous is set,looping will be applied - and unless loop_count is set or there is some other waythe sound will be muted, that means the sound can potentially continue indefinitely. If an instrument is using the default loop_mode=no_loop, there is no need to setloop_mode=one_shot for the release samples; however, if an instrument hasloop_mode=loop_continuous set under a header which also includes release samples,the release regions will normally need to be set to loop_mode=one_shot to override that. In ARIA, if loop_mode=loop_continuous or loop_sustain, loop_end is not specified,and the sample does not have a loop defined, the player will loop throughthe entire sample file. Examples: loop_mode=no_looploop_mode=loop_continuous"

Note thathirand for a region should equal lorand for the next region - if we had, forexample, hirand=0. 249 for the first region and lorand=0. 25 for the next,that would result in no sound playing if the random number generated was, forexample, 0. 2496343491.

This results in randomization, but prevents the possibility of the same samplebeing triggered twice in a row when the random number generated falls into thesame range as the previously generated number. This can be good when there area lot (6 or more) round robin samples available. The code for 8 samples splitinto two sequential subsets might look like this: &lt;region&gt; seq_length=2 seq_position=1 hirand=0. 25 sample=kick_vl1_rr1. wav&lt;region&gt; seq_length=2 seq_position=1 lorand=0. 25 hirand=0. 5 sample=kick_vl1_rr2. wav&lt;region&gt; seq_length=2 seq_position=1 lorand=0. 5 hirand=0. 75 sample=kick_vl1_rr3. wav&lt;region&gt; seq_length=2 seq_position=1 lorand=0. 75 sample=kick_vl1_rr4. wav&lt;region&gt; seq_length=2 seq_position=2 hirand=0. 25 sample=kick_vl1_rr5. wav&lt;region&gt; seq_length=2 seq_position=2 lorand=0. 25 hirand=0. 5 sample=kick_vl1_rr6. wav&lt;region&gt; seq_length=2 seq_position=2 lorand=0. 5 hirand=0. 75 sample=kick_vl1_rr7. wav&lt;region&gt; seq_length=2 seq_position=2 lorand=0. 75 sample=kick_vl1_rr8. wavPractical Considerations: In the ARIA implementation of SFZ, sequence position is not tracked together forall regions, which means the above is not a practical way to implement alternatingleft/right hand or up/down bowing samples. Also in ARIA, a separate random number is generated for each region which is playing,which means lorand/hirand probably should not be used with samples which havemultiple mic positions. Using it can result in triggering spot, overhead and roommics which do not match, and that can result in phasing issues etc. There are other potential uses which have nothing to do with round robins, forexample having key fingering noises on a clarinet trigger sometimes(but not always) when a note is played.

Though dynamic layers can also be controlled by CC, especially for sustainedinstruments, lovel and hivel are the standard way of controlling dynamics forinstruments such as drums and pianos. It is also possible to use lovel / hivelto control other things instead, such as articulations - for example, a guitarcould have palm-muted samples on low velocities, and pinch harmonics on velocity 127. These opcodes will often need to be used with amp_velcurve_N, unlessamp_veltrack is set to 0. The reason for this is that with defaultvelocity tracking behavior and non-normalized samples (and there are many reasonswhy normalizing samples should be avoided), the quiet velocity layers will be too quiet. Velocity 0 is a note-off message, so 1 is the lowest usable value with hivel/lovel. Example: lovel=64 hivel=95An instrument with four velocity-controlled dynamic layers might use lovel andhivel like this: &lt;region&gt;hivel=31 amp_velcurve_31=1 sample=kick_vl1. wav&lt;region&gt;lovel=32 hivel=63 amp_velcurve_63=1 sample=kick_vl2. wav&lt;region&gt;lovel=64 hivel=95 amp_velcurve_95=1 sample=kick_vl3. wav&lt;region&gt;lovel=96 sample=kick_vl4. wavThe way this would work is the kick_vl1. wav region will play at velocities upto 31, with volume going gradually from 0 at velocity 0 (so, no sound) to fullvolume at velocity 31. The kick_vl2. wav region will play at velocties 32 to 63,with volume being full at velocity 63 and lower volume (but not zero) at 32. The kick_vl3 wav region will play at velocites 64 to 95, with full volume atvelocity 95. Finally, the kick_vl4 layer plays at velocities 96 to 127, with noamp_velcurve_N set meaning it will have full volume at velocity 127. "

The additions in SFZ 2 are:  pitch bend: 128 channel aftertouch: 129 polyphonic aftertouch: 130 note on velocity: 131 note off velocity: 132 keyboard note number: 133 keyboard note gate: 134 unipolar random: 135 bipolar random: 136 alternate: 137Values such as note on velocity and MIDI note number, when used as CCs, do notbehave exactly the same as note number or velocity of the note itself, insome contexts. This is because once a note is played, its MIDI note number andnote on velocity remain the same for that note. MIDI CC, however, is sharedacross the entire instrument, and this means another note on or note off eventwill change CC 131, 132 and 133. This can give unexpected results when usingthese CCs to adjust keytracking or velocity tracking of various parameters,especially in polyphonic instruments with long-sustaining sounds. Note gate is an on/off - it’s 0 when no MIDI notes are pressed, and 1 whenat least one note is currently pressed. Unipolar random is from 0 to 1. Bipolar random is from -1 to 1. Alternate changes between 0 and 1 every timea note on message is received. Some of the parameters, such as aftertouch and note off velocity, are rarelysupported by modern MIDI hardware controllers, though they are part of the MIDIspecification and can be edited in DAWs. Many MIDI keyboards will send adefault note off velocity, such as 64, with every note off event regardless ofhow fast the key was actually moving at the time. Anything above 137 is not specified in the SFZ 2 standard and strictlyengine-dependent. ARIA adds more. Some of these might not work properly inall DAWs.  keydelta: 140 keydelta absolute: 141 host tempo (bpm): 142 host transport status (0 is off, 1 on in non-loop mode, 2 is playing in loop mode): 143 host sample rate: 144 time since the engine has been up: 145 current time signature numerator: 146 current time signature denominator: 147 position since song start in PPQ (pulses per quarter note): 148 position since bar start in PPQ: 149 time since the instrument has been up: 150 time since last key on (in seconds): 151 time since last key off (in seconds): 152 number of keys currently down: 153 number of currently active voices: 154 last playahead (offset) of any sample in the instrument: 155Practical Considerations: While all the “regular” CCs have the same range of 0 to 127, and some of these extended CCsbehave the same way (for example CC 131 or note on velocity), others do not. CC136 or bipolarrandom can have a negative value, for example. Many will often have non-integer values. These CCs will not always behave the same as others and have not been thoroughly documented. Some of the additional CCs are shared across all instances of the ARIA engine currently running,for example the host tempo. Others can have concurrently have a different value for differentinstances or different instruments concurrently, for example keydelta. CC 140 and 141 are measured in half-steps. So, the below will result in an envelope with a depthof 100 cents per half-step. This is typically what would be used for portamento glides. eg07_pitch_oncc140=100Using locc and hicc with CC 140 and 141 does not work the same as for other CCs. However, theycan be used with lohdcc and hihdcc. For example, the below will restrict a region to play onlywhen the interval between the current note and the previous one is an octave, ascending. Whetherthe decimal is necessary needs to be tested, but the below is confirmed to work. lohdc140=12hihdcc140=12. 1Using lohdcc alone does not work and will result in the region not triggering, but adding hihdccwith a high value will. The below example was tested in an instrument with a range of less thantwo octaves, and there works as a way to trigger some regions only when the interval is more thanone octave in either direction. lohdcc141=12. 1hihdcc141=24CC 151 is reset as soon as a new note is hit, so it cannot be used to measurethe time between the previous note and the current one, for adaptive legatospeed purposes. It can, however, be used to control the triggering of release samples. LikeCC140 and CC141, it also requires using hdcc to function properly - which makes sense, astime since note-on as measured in seconds usually involves fractions of a second in realscenarios. In Cakewalk Dimension Pro, 140 is bitred and 141 is decim.

The instrument can be decluttered to this: &lt;group&gt;hicc100=63#include  sample_map. sfz &lt;group&gt;locc100=64group=1off_by=1#include  sample_map. sfz Include And File Paths: With large instruments which would be broken down into many files, the included files can be placed in a differentfolder or in a subfolder of the folder containing the instruments. Regardless of which file folder the includedfiles are in, the sample file paths and include file paths will be calculated starting with the folder which containsthe instrument file. So, if our above example instrument has the main SFZ file, called main. sfz, in a Programs folder under the instrumentroot, samples in a Samples folder under that, and the sample_map. sfz is in Programs/mappings, then main. sfz should contain: &lt;group&gt;hicc100=63#include  mappings/sample_map. sfz &lt;group&gt;locc100=64group=1off_by=1#include  mappings/sample_map. sfz The sample_map. sfz file in mappings should have the following contents: &lt;region&gt;key=48 sample=. . /Samples/c4. wav&lt;region&gt;key=49 sample=. . /Samples/db4. wav&lt;region&gt;key=50 sample=. . /Samples/d4. wav&lt;region&gt;key=51 sample=. . /Samples/eb4. wav&lt;region&gt;key=52 sample=. . /Samples/e4. wav&lt;region&gt;key=53 sample=. . /Samples/f4. wav&lt;region&gt;key=54 sample=. . /Samples/gb4. wav&lt;region&gt;key=55 sample=. . /Samples/g4. wav&lt;region&gt;key=56 sample=. . /Samples/ab4. wav&lt;region&gt;key=57 sample=. . /Samples/a4. wav&lt;region&gt;key=58 sample=. . /Samples/bb4. wav&lt;region&gt;key=59 sample=. . /Samples/b4. wav&lt;region&gt;key=60 sample=. . /Samples/c5. wavThis means that opening the main. sfz file will work, but trying to open sample_map. sfz directly would not, as it wouldtry to locate the samples in a relative path of . . /Samples, which exists when starting from Programs, but does not existwhen starting from Programs/modules. This can make testing sample maps somewhat messy, as they need to be moved out oftheir “proper” folder if the map needs to be tested by itself, without the rest of the SFZ. Include And Nesting: Included files can, themselves, include files. This is not a problem, just avoid circular recursion. Other Use Cases For Include: In addition to sample maps, modulations can also be reused. For example, a common set of vibrato controls can be includedfor violin samples which need them, but left out for samples which don’t, such as harmonics, percussive noises and legatotransitions. Different dynamics controls for long vs. short bowed articulations are also candidates for such treatment. &lt;master&gt;sw_last=34sw_label=Sustain#include  modules/vibrato. sfz #include  modules/long_dynamics. sfz #include  mappings/sustain. sfz &lt;master&gt;sw_last=33sw_label=Staccato#include  modules/vibrato. sfz #include  modules/short_dynamics. sfz #include  mappings/staccato. sfz &lt;master&gt;sw_last=32sw_label=Natural harmonics#include  modules/long_dynamics. sfz #include  mappings/harmonics. sfz &lt;master&gt;sw_last=31sw_label=Percussive noises#include  modules/short_dynamics. sfz #include  mappings/noises. sfz The same file can also be included in multiple instruments, for example a violin spiccato articulation map canbe used in both a spiccato-only instrument and in a keyswitch instrument which contains other articulations aswell. Putting each set of round robins inside its own file without defining [seq_position]inside that file can also be useful for emulating double-tracking. If the basic non-doubletracked instrument is set up like this: &lt;global&gt;seq_length=4&lt;group&gt;seq_position=1#include  mappings/palm_mute_rr1_map. sfz &lt;group&gt;seq_position=2#include  mappings/palm_mute_rr2_map. sfz &lt;group&gt;seq_position=3#include  mappings/palm_mute_rr3_map. sfz &lt;group&gt;seq_position=4#include  mappings/palm_mute_rr4_map. sfz It then becomes very simple to make a doubletracked instrument which uses differnt round robins in the left and right channels: &lt;global&gt;seq_length=4&lt;group&gt;pan=100seq_position=1#include  mappings/palm_mute_rr1_map. sfz &lt;group&gt;pan=100seq_position=2#include  mappings/palm_mute_rr2_map. sfz &lt;group&gt;pan=100seq_position=3#include  mappings/palm_mute_rr3_map. sfz &lt;group&gt;pan=100seq_position=4#include  mappings/palm_mute_rr4_map. sfz &lt;group&gt;pan=-100seq_position=1#include  mappings/palm_mute_rr2_map. sfz &lt;group&gt;pan=-100seq_position=2#include  mappings/palm_mute_rr3_map. sfz &lt;group&gt;pan=-100seq_position=3#include  mappings/palm_mute_rr4_map. sfz &lt;group&gt;pan=-100seq_position=4#include  mappings/palm_mute_rr1_map. sfz Include And Headers: When including files, it’s common to put lower levels of [header] organization,such as region and group in the included file, and put higher levels in the main file. However, this is not necessary, and any levels of headers can be included. It is important to keep in mind that included files are essentially just concatenated to make the SFZ file whichthe SFZ instrument actually parses. Although an included file is a little like a procedure in a programming language, itisn’t really one, and the end of the included file is not meaningful when SFZ opcodes set under headers within an included file will be in effect until encountering another header of the same orhigher level. For example, let’s say a snare drum sample map contains one-shot samples under &lt;region&gt; headers and alsomultisampled hits under a &lt;group&gt; header later in the file, and this file is called snare_map. sfz. &lt;region&gt;key=37sample=Sidestick. wav&lt;region&gt;key=39sample=Off_center. wav&lt;region&gt;key=40sample=Rimshot. wav&lt;group&gt;key=38seq_length=4&lt;region&gt;seq_position=1sample=Center_rr1. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=2sample=Center_rr2. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=3sample=Center_rr3. wav&lt;region&gt;seq_position=4sample=Center_rr4. wavIf we want to put snare controls which apply to all those, this would work: &lt;master&gt;amplitude_oncc100=100tune_oncc101=1200tune_curvecc101=1#include  snare_map. sfz This, however, would make the controls affect the sidesticks, off-center hits and rimshot, but not the center hits: &lt;group&gt;amplitude_oncc100=100tune_oncc101=1200tune_curvecc101=1#include  snare_map. sfz That is because the opcodes set under the &lt;group&gt; header would only be active until the &lt;group&gt; header for the centerhits is reached. If a &lt;master&gt; header is used, they remain in force until another &lt;master&gt; header is encountered. Whenthe headers are not immediately visible because they’re in an included file, it is easy to fall into this kind of trap. The Define Statement: In addition to include, [#define] is the other statement which is very usefulin making instruments more modular. Define and include can be used together. For example, user-editable parameters, such as MIDI note assignments for drum kitsand CC ranges, can also be placed in a separate file such as the below. #define $KICKKEY 36#define $SIDESTICKKEY 37#define $SNAREKEY 38The defined variables can then be used throughout the instrument, and an end user who wants to change the keymap can edit thefile containing the defined numbers without having to search through the entire instrument. In the specific implementation of ARIA,anything which uses the defined variables also needs to be placed in the main SFZ file using include, because of the way ARIAparses SFZ files, described in more detail under the opcode page. Using define as a constant with a single value thorughout an instrument works easily. Defining the same variable to have multiplevalues at different points in the same instrument, however, requires care. Using #define to set the same variable to differentvalues at one point in the same SFZ file does not work well at least in ARIA/Sforzando when loading an instrument. However, aworkaround there is to use include to put each set of define statements with different values in a separate file. In simpletests, that has been successful. Sometimes copying large chunks of SFZ code and performing search-replace within them is easier than redefining variables comes intoplay. There’s a balance of when to use include statements and when to just copy some files and use search-replace. Multiple defined variables can be used in the same line. #define $MIC_NAME Room#define $MIC_MIX_CC 32&lt;control&gt;label_cc$MIC_MIX_CC=$MIC_NAMEOne thing to keep in mind is that each variable name should be unique. This is good: #define $SNARE_KEY 38#define $SNARE_RIMSHOT_KEY 40This will fail in at least some SFZ players, because the complete name of one variable is also the start of another variable’s name: #define $SNARE 38#define $SNARE_RIMSHOT 40      [header]:    {{ ‘/headers/’   relative_url }}       [#define]:   {{ ‘/opcodes/define’   relative_url }}       [#include]:   {{ ‘/opcodes/include’   relative_url }}       [seq_position]: {{ ‘/opcodes/seq_position’   relative_url }}   "

The note_polyphony opcode is thus not a strict polyphony limit but more of a hintfor the instrument behavior. This behavior is indeed generally desirablewhen playing repeated piano notes, hammered dulcimers, etc. It can also be useful for cymbals, although especially with hi-hats,those will often use different notes for different articulations,and note_polyphony would be limited to working within an articulation. The note polyphony is checked within a polyphony group, set by the group orpolyphony_group opcodes. If no group is specified on the region (or its group,master or globally) the note polyphony applies to the default groupas if group=0 was specified. This means that instruments where one note needs to trigger multiple layers,for example drums with separate microphone samples, will usually need to seta separate group number for each microphone position, so the note polyphony limitis tracked separately for each mic.

Examples: off_mode=fastoff_mode=normalNote that the default is fast, and not normal, which means that“normal isn’t normal”, and if normal is needed, it will need to be set explicitly.

If pitch_keycenter is set to sample and thefile metadata does not contain pitch information, it defaults to MIDI note 0. If samples contain good quality metadata, setting pitch_keycenter to samplecan be simpler than setting the keycenter for each individual sample. If pitch_keycenter is set to sample and key is also used, the behavior dependson the sampler. ARIA uses the value set using the key opcode, while rgc sfz andCakewalk products use the value from the sample metadata.

Examples: polyphony=12polyphony=5polyphony=legato_lowAn example limiting a crash cymbal to four polyphony voices. group=1polyphony=4&lt;region&gt; key=49 sample=crash. wavHere is a ride limited to a total of seven voices, with both bow and bellarticulations sharing the same polyphony group and the same seven-voicelimit. group=2polyphony=7&lt;region&gt; key=51 sample=ride_bow. wav&lt;region&gt; key=53 sample=ride_bell. wavThis opcode is useful for controlling sound buildup, limiting resource use,and for emulating the behavior of vintage keyboards with limited polyphony. It’s also possible to use [note_polyphony] instead when all the sounds we wantto mute each other are mapped to the same pitch, or use both in combination. An alternative for controlling sound buildup is using[ampeg_release] with [off_mode] set to normal. It’s also possible to have a group with limited polyphony which can be muted byanother group, such as a cymbal with edge chokes. &lt;group&gt;group=2off_by=3polyphony=7&lt;region&gt; key=51 sample=ride_bow. wav&lt;region&gt; key=53 sample=ride_bell. wav&lt;group&gt;group=3&lt;region&gt; key=54 sample=ride. choke. wavAn alternative is [note_polyphony]. The difference betweenapplying polyphony across one note and using note_polyphony is thatnote_polyphony also uses [note_selfmask] which opens up some additional options. With the default setting, lower-velocity notes do not mute higher-velocity ones. This is useful for long-ringing instruments such as piano with the sustain pedalpressed down or hammered dulcimer. It can also be useful for cymbals, althoughespecially with hi-hats, those will often use different notes for differentarticulations, and note_polyphony would be limited to working within anarticulation.

    "body": "ARIA adds also the polyphony_group alias to reduce the confusion betweenthe group opcode and the ‹[group]› header. Examples: group=3group=334The group opcode is used together with off_by to make something monophonic. For example, the flute is by nature a monophonic instrument, so if a flute wererecorded with one microphone and had one set of samples, it would make sense toset all its samples to have one group. A guitar is polyphonic, but each stringis monophonic, so a six-string guitar would naturally be split into six groups -one per string. In these cases, the group number will be equal to the off_bynumber. This is also commonly used with hi-hats - this is an example of where things canget more sophisticated with a large number of groups involved, as it’s possibleto set more closed hi-hat sounds mute more open ones, but not vice-versa, and it’salso quite possible that there are separate close mic, overhead and room samples. group and off_by can also be used in other contexts where one soundshould cause another to stop but enforcing monophony is not the goal - for example,a crash cymbal doesn’t need to be monophonic, as allowing the sound to build upis reasonably natural, but if we wanted to implement a cymbal choke, then thecrash sounds would be in one group, the choke samples in another. Practical Considerations: The actual minimum and maximum values are not currently known. Some playerswill treat numbers outside a certain range as equivalent to group=0, andARIA/Sforzando will also do this with text strings. The behavior ofnon-integer numbers is also currently unknown. This makes it possible to usean extremely large number for one group, but it’s obviously not recommended. [group]: {{ ‘/headers/group’ | relative_url }} "

    "title": "Range extension",
    "body": "This tutorial describes how to extend the range of an instrument which does nothave samples for all notes in the desired range. This is not complicated, butthere are some downsides to doing it the simple way. Things work the same waywhen extending up or down. When there are intermediate pitches missing, forexample when an instrument is sampled every minor third or every octave, therewon’t be much choice, though if round robins are available the last approachcan prove useful. Simple extension of closest avaialble sample: Let’s say we have only one sampled violin section with the following map, andwe want to be able to play the notes for another octave above the highestcurrently avaialble note. &lt;region&gt;sample=c4. wav key=48&lt;region&gt;sample=db4. wav key=49&lt;region&gt;sample=d4. wav key=50&lt;region&gt;sample=eb4. wav key=51&lt;region&gt;sample=e4. wav key=52&lt;region&gt;sample=f4. wav key=53&lt;region&gt;sample=gb4. wav key=54&lt;region&gt;sample=g4. wav key=55&lt;region&gt;sample=ab4. wav key=56&lt;region&gt;sample=a4. wav key=57&lt;region&gt;sample=bb4. wav key=58&lt;region&gt;sample=b4. wav key=59&lt;region&gt;sample=c5. wav key=60The simplest way is to just stretch the highest note. Usinglokey, hikey and pitch_keycenter as separate opcodes is better than using key and transpose, as it allows one regionto cover a wide range of pitches. &lt;region&gt;sample=c5. wav lokey=60 hikey=72 pitch_keycenter=60Note that ARIA will produce no sound if asked to transposea sample more than four octaves up - if that is needed,create some extra copies of the samples and transpose themin an audio editor. This accounts for transposition, pitchbend and any other tuning adjustments, so if an octave ofpitch bend is needed, the maximum effectively avaialabletranspotition becomes an octave less. There is no similarlimitation with downward transposition, though. Filling in missing pitches: In the above case, the range is being stretched upwards, butthe same principle applies if there are notes missing withinthe range, whether due to recording errors, or the limitationsof instruments which can’t produce all notes of the chromaticscale. Let’s say we have a simple pentatonic xylophone. &lt;region&gt;sample=c4. wav key=48&lt;region&gt;sample=d4. wav key=50&lt;region&gt;sample=f4. wav key=53&lt;region&gt;sample=g4. wav key=55&lt;region&gt;sample=a4. wav key=57&lt;region&gt;sample=c5. wav key=60&lt;region&gt;sample=d5. wav key=62&lt;region&gt;sample=f5. wav key=65&lt;region&gt;sample=g5. wav key=67&lt;region&gt;sample=a5. wav key=69&lt;region&gt;sample=c6. wav key=72This would work similar as above, covering everypitch with the nearest available note. Whetherto stretch up or down when there are two equallydistant notes available is a judgment call. It mightbe worth trying both to see which sounds best. The below example goes up and doesn’t extend the rangebeyond the highest or lowest available sample, onlyfills in the gaps. &lt;region&gt;sample=c4. wav lokey=48 hikey=49 pitch_keycenter=48&lt;region&gt;sample=d4. wav lokey=50 hikey=51 pitch_keycenter=50&lt;region&gt;sample=f4. wav lokey=52 hikey=54 pitch_keycenter=53&lt;region&gt;sample=g4. wav lokey=55 hikey=56 pitch_keycenter=55&lt;region&gt;sample=a4. wav lokey=57 hikey=58 pitch_keycenter=57&lt;region&gt;sample=c5. wav lokey=59 hikey=61 pitch_keycenter=59&lt;region&gt;sample=d5. wav lokey=62 hikey=63 pitch_keycenter=62&lt;region&gt;sample=f5. wav lokey=64 hikey=66 pitch_keycenter=65&lt;region&gt;sample=g5. wav lokey=67 hikey=68 pitch_keycenter=67&lt;region&gt;sample=a5. wav lokey=69 hikey=70 pitch_keycenter=69&lt;region&gt;sample=c6. wav lokey=71 hikey=72 pitch_keycenter=72Alternating several samples: The above is good enough in a lot of cases, though it mightbecome obviously audible that the entire top octave usesthe same sample. We could use the top two or three samplesinstead, and alternate them like this: &lt;region&gt;sample=c5. wav key=60&lt;region&gt;sample=bb4. wav lokey=61 hikey=61 pitch_keycenter=58&lt;region&gt;sample=b4. wav lokey=62 hikey=62 pitch_keycenter=59&lt;region&gt;sample=c5. wav lokey=63 hikey=63 pitch_keycenter=60&lt;region&gt;sample=bb4. wav lokey=64 hikey=64 pitch_keycenter=58&lt;region&gt;sample=b4. wav lokey=65 hikey=65 pitch_keycenter=59&lt;region&gt;sample=c5. wav lokey=66 hikey=66 pitch_keycenter=60…and so on, continuing to the highest desired note. Using different round robins: However, in the above case, notes a minor third apart willstill use the same sample, and there’s a minor third intervalin both minor and major triads. There might not be a good wayto get around this with the sample set we have above, but if wehave two round robins, we could do something like this: &lt;group&gt;seq_length=2&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr1. wav key=48&lt;region&gt;sample=db4_rr1. wav key=49&lt;region&gt;sample=d4_rr1. wav key=50&lt;region&gt;sample=eb4_rr1. wav key=51&lt;region&gt;sample=e4_rr1. wav key=52&lt;region&gt;sample=f4_rr1. wav key=53&lt;region&gt;sample=gb4_rr1. wav key=54&lt;region&gt;sample=g4_rr1. wav key=55&lt;region&gt;sample=ab4_rr1. wav key=56&lt;region&gt;sample=a4_rr1. wav key=57&lt;region&gt;sample=bb4_rr1. wav key=58&lt;region&gt;sample=b4_rr1. wav key=59&lt;region&gt;sample=c5_rr1. wav key=60&lt;region&gt;sample=bb4_rr2. wav lokey=61 hikey=61 pitch_keycenter=58&lt;region&gt;sample=b4_rr2. wav lokey=62 hikey=62 pitch_keycenter=59&lt;region&gt;sample=c5_rr2. wav lokey=63 hikey=63 pitch_keycenter=60&lt;region&gt;sample=bb4_rr1. wav lokey=64 hikey=64 pitch_keycenter=58&lt;region&gt;sample=b4_rr1. wav lokey=65 hikey=65 pitch_keycenter=59&lt;region&gt;sample=c5_rr1. wav lokey=66 hikey=66 pitch_keycenter=60&lt;region&gt;sample=bb4_rr2. wav lokey=67 hikey=67 pitch_keycenter=58&lt;region&gt;sample=b4_rr2. wav lokey=68 hikey=68 pitch_keycenter=59&lt;region&gt;sample=c5_rr2. wav lokey=69 hikey=69 pitch_keycenter=60&lt;region&gt;sample=bb4_rr1. wav lokey=70 hikey=70 pitch_keycenter=58&lt;region&gt;sample=b4_rr1. wav lokey=71 hikey=71 pitch_keycenter=59&lt;region&gt;sample=c5_rr1. wav lokey=72 hikey=72 pitch_keycenter=60&lt;group&gt;seq_length=2seq_position=2&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr2. wav key=48&lt;region&gt;sample=db4_rr2. wav key=49&lt;region&gt;sample=d4_rr2. wav key=50&lt;region&gt;sample=eb4_rr2. wav key=51&lt;region&gt;sample=e4_rr2. wav key=52&lt;region&gt;sample=f4_rr2. wav key=53&lt;region&gt;sample=gb4_rr2. wav key=54&lt;region&gt;sample=g4_rr2. wav key=55&lt;region&gt;sample=ab4_rr2. wav key=56&lt;region&gt;sample=a4_rr2. wav key=57&lt;region&gt;sample=bb4_rr2. wav key=58&lt;region&gt;sample=b4_rr2. wav key=59&lt;region&gt;sample=c5_rr2. wav key=60&lt;region&gt;sample=bb4_rr1. wav lokey=61 hikey=61 pitch_keycenter=58&lt;region&gt;sample=b4_rr1. wav lokey=62 hikey=62 pitch_keycenter=59&lt;region&gt;sample=c5_rr1. wav lokey=63 hikey=63 pitch_keycenter=60&lt;region&gt;sample=bb4_rr2. wav lokey=64 hikey=64 pitch_keycenter=58&lt;region&gt;sample=b4_rr2. wav lokey=65 hikey=65 pitch_keycenter=59&lt;region&gt;sample=c5_rr2. wav lokey=66 hikey=66 pitch_keycenter=60&lt;region&gt;sample=bb4_rr1. wav lokey=67 hikey=67 pitch_keycenter=58&lt;region&gt;sample=b4_rr1. wav lokey=68 hikey=68 pitch_keycenter=59&lt;region&gt;sample=c5_rr1. wav lokey=69 hikey=69 pitch_keycenter=60&lt;region&gt;sample=bb4_rr2. wav lokey=70 hikey=70 pitch_keycenter=58&lt;region&gt;sample=b4_rr2. wav lokey=71 hikey=71 pitch_keycenter=59&lt;region&gt;sample=c5_rr2. wav lokey=72 hikey=72 pitch_keycenter=60This is obviously much more complicated than the simple versionwe started with, and the extra complexity might not be worth itin many cases, but if needed things can be done this way. Recording extra notes: In cases where it’s very important to avoid using the samesample too many times, it’s possible to start addressing thisat the recording stage, and record additional samples of the noteswhich will need to be stretched. Of course this could be morework than just recording the target pitches in the first place,but if the pitches are difficult to produce consistently (for example are notes that a singer can hit only with considerablestrain) or just physically fall outside the range, it may be aviable option. True legato samples. : Extending the range with true legato samples requires extending the rangefor both the previous note (the sw_previous values) and the new note(the lokey/hikey values). Here is a process which has worked in practicefor extending the range of a legato instrument upwards by a major second:  Copy regions with the key to be extended. Add the amount of shift (3 if taking the second-highest and third-lowest note and extending the range by a major second) to sw_previous, lokey and hikey to the copy.  Copy regions with the sw_previous to be extended except those already copied in the previous step. Likewise add the amount of shift to sw_previous, lokey and hikey to the copy.  Delete the regions with sw_previous above the new max range (or could try avoiding copying them in the first step, but this way is probably safer).  Add in regions going from the bottom three values of sw_previous to the new notes. This is where some sort of defaults, as mentioned above, will be needed.  Add regions going from the new extended notes to the bottom three pitches, as above. Note that there will be no legato samples covering the widest intervalsfrom the extended notes to the farthest notes on the other side. If theinstrument has legato samples only recorded within a certain range (forexample only for intervals up to an octave), this isn’t going to createany additional problems that didn’t already have to be solved when makingthe non-extended legato instruments - so whether defaulting to thelargest interval sampled, triggering a regular sustain or just producingno sound at all, just do the same when there’s no interval wide enoughfor a leap to or from an extended note. If an instrument does have everypossible note transition in its range sampled, however (quite possiblefor instruments with a small range, such as rebab), the samecompromises are available for the missing intervals in the extended range.

Range is 0 to 200. In general, higher values mean high decrease of the release sample volume with time,which makes sense for release samples associated with sounds which decay quicklywhen held. For example, higher piano notes decay much faster than lower ones, sothe higher notes will need higher rt_decay values. Release samples for sounds which do not naturally decay, such as organs orguitar feedback, do not need their volume to decrease based on note duration,and can use the default value of 0. Practical Considerations: In ARIA, extended MIDI CC 151 can be used alongside rt_decay to select different releasesamples for different time ranges. However, CCs have one value across the entireinstrument. CC 151 is time since the last note-on message in seconds. This can giveundesired results in arpeggios.

This should include a relative file path from thefolder where the SFZ file is. In most cases, there will be a sample opcode in every region of an SFZ file,though not always. If the sample file is not found, the player will ignore the whole regioncontents as there’s nothing to play. Long names and names with blank spaces andother special characters (excepting the = character) are allowed in the sampledefinition. Getting the sample to play back at the correct pitch is not automatic, andgenerally can’t be done with the sample opcode alone, even if the file nameincludes pitch information. Assuming that the tune or transpose opcodes are notused to change the pitch, the sample will play unchanged in pitch when a noteequal to the pitch_keycenter opcode value is played. If pitch_keycenter is not defined for the region, sample willplay unchanged on note 60 (middle C). If pitch_keytrackis set to 0, the sample will also play unchanged in pitch,regardless of how pitch_keycenter is set. If the key opcode is used to define the range of the sample (instead of lokey,hikey and pitch_keycenter) the sample will also be unchanged in pitch. Formats: At the SFZ1 specification level, the supported sample formats are:  WAV of any sample rate Ogg Vorbis compressed samplesFor SFZ2, the Cakewalk book specifies the following sample types in addiction ofthe above:  AIFF of any sample rate [FLAC] support is not specified as mandatory, though FLAC was supported byCakewalk Session Drummer, and is supported by ARIASee also [Features] section in the home page. WAV is usually the first choice, or perhaps AIFF when using macOS. FLAC is the second choice, as it is [lossless] compression audio is always preferable,though it needs to be decoded which can cause slower performance compared to WAV. Other compressed formats can be used for test cases or situations where keepingthe file size small is more important than audio quality. See also the table of supported sample [formats] by some engines for more details. Examples: sample=A3. wavsample=. . \Samples\close\c4_pp_rr3. wavEach engine can also support custom oscillators. For example, ARIA supportsusing this opcode for some basic synthesized sound waves such as: sample=*sinesample=*sawsample=*squaresample=*trianglesample=*trisample=*noisesample=*silenceTri is an alias for triangle. For cases where we don’t want to actually playa sample but want a region to exist and be played(for example, to mute other sounds when using group andoff_by, the silence value can be very convenient).

Some players also match velocity ranges for each step in the sequence, whichcan cause problems when the sequence steps do not have the same velocitylayer split points.

    "body": "The set of [modulations] available under the SFZ1 specification is fixed, andthere’s a dedicated opcode for every possible modulation, including fairlyesoteric ones such as using note velocity to modulate the hold stage of thepitch envelope. Basic MIDI CC modulation: A few opcodes can be modulated simply by MIDI CC, with the modulation addingto what the opcode would normally do. These are: [offset] and [delay]. For example, this would have a sample offset of 500 when the modulating CC isat 0, and a sample offset of 1000 when the modulating CC is at max: offset=500offset_cc100=500It’s also possible to just specify the modulation, in which case thedefault value is what will be modulated. The defaults for offset, delay andEQ band gain are 0, so this would result in the offset being modulated between0 and 1000: offset_cc100=1000Modulating default values: The three EQ bands’ [frequency][1], [bandwidth] and [gain][2] work similarly,but also add velocity tracking. The EQ bandwidth and center frequency also havenon-zero defaults,for example eq2_freq is 500 if not specified. So, this would modulate the centerfrequency of the second EQ band between 500 and 1500 if eq2_freq is left at default: eq2_freqcc110=1000Velocity tracking, keytracking and randomization: EQ [frequency][3] and [gain][4] (but not bandwidth) can additionally be modulated by velocity. For example, if we want to make a sound brighter when the velocity is higher,we might use something like this: eq1_vel2gain=-6eq2_vel2gain=12eq2_vel2freq=500The [xfin]/[xfout] CCs are also a way to fade sounds in and out using MIDI CC. An example of one note with two dynamic layers being crossfaded: &lt;region&gt;sample=e4_ft_p. wav xfin_locc1=0 xfin_hicc1=63 xfout_locc1=64 xfout_hicc1=127&lt;region&gt;sample=e4_ft_f. wav xfin_locc1=64 xfin_hicc1=127In addition to MIDI CC, crossfades can also use MIDI note number and velocity asmodulation sources, and the [xf_cccurve], [xf_keycurve] and [xf_velcurve]give the choice of two curves for each of these modulations. More sophisticated modulations are possible with volume,pitch and [filter cutoff]. Volume and cutoff can be modulated by MIDI CC directly(pitch can’t in SFZ1 - the tune_ccN modulation is an ARIA extension). All threecan also have randomization applied and be modulated by MIDI note number andvelocity. The nomenclature for volume is a little confusing, with [gain_ccN] using“gain” in the name, while the others are called [amp_random],[amp_keytrack] and [amp_veltrack]. gain_cc80=-6amp_random=3amp_keytrack=-1. 3amp_veltrack=80LFOs and envelopes: Volume, filter and cutoff also each get an LFO and anenvelope. The LFO rate anddepth can be modulated by MIDI CC. Each LFO also has a simple envelope withdelay and fade, but modulating the duration of these is not allowed under theSFZ1 spec (though it is with SFZ2 LFOs). Here’s a typical pitch vibrato LFO: pitchlfo_freq=2pitchlfo_freqcc50=10pitchlfo_depthcc51=33Each envelope parameter can also be modulated by CC, or by velocity. Here’s aexmple setup for a synth-style ADSR volume envelope (hold is not specified so thedefault hold value of 0 is used) controlled by CCs and some initialminimum values set for attack and release, along with a default sustain of 0: ampeg_attack=0. 001ampeg_attack_oncc40=1ampeg_decay_oncc41=4ampeg_sustain=1ampeg_sustain_oncc42=100ampeg_release=0. 1ampeg_release_oncc43=0. 9Modulating envelope parameters with velocity allows, for example, setting up a filteron an acid bass which will sweep farther with higher velocity, and also sweep faster. cutoff=120resonance=12fileg_attack=0. 5fileg_decay=1fileg_depth=500fileg_vel2attack=-0. 4fileg_vel2decay=-0. 8fileg_vel2depth=4000If something is not described above, then modulating it is not possible under theSFZ1 specification, and will require using SFZ2 or possibly some extension opcodes.

All SFZ1 modulations are still available under the SFZ2 spec,and will often be easier to use in cases such as envelopes where the standardAHDSR shape is all that’s needed. The basic difference is that SFZ1 has three envelopes - one assigned tovolume, one to pitch, and one to filter cutoff. There are also three LFOs,one for each of those modulation targets. SFZ2 can have an arbitraty numberof envelopes and LFOs, with the ability to specify one or more modulationtargets from a list. It is even possible for LFOs to modulate other LFOsand envelopes to modulate LFOs (but not for LFOs to modulate envelopes). In addition, SFZ2 envelopes can have an arbitrary number of points. Additional MIDI CC modulation: SFZ2 adds one more paramter which can be modulated with MIDI CC - [stereo width]. Also need to document pan_onccX and find out whether it’s SFZ1 or SFZ2 - currentlynot sure, needs testing. LFOs: For each LFO, an LFO number must be specified - lfo01, lfo02 etc. EachLFO has the following parameters: [lfoN_wave][lfoN_freq][lfoN_freq_onccX][lfoN_freq_smoothccX][lfoN_freq_stepccX][lfoN_delay][lfoN_delay_onccX][lfoN_fade][lfoN_fade_onccX][lfoN_phase][lfoN_phase_onccX][lfoN_count] Click on each link for a detailed description. Similarly to SFZ1 LFOs,there’s a frequency, a delay and a fade-in time. In addition, thewaveform shape and initial phase can be specified and the LFO canbe configured to run for a limited number of counts. The frequency, delay, fade and initial phase can all be modulated byMIDI CC. There is no modulation for LFO depth - to control the depthof vibrato etc, use MIDI CC to modulate how much the LFO affects thedesired target. Available LFO targets: The available modulation targets for LFOs are These destinations areadded as a suffix to ‘lfoN_’. For example lfo01_pitch=100makes LFO 01 affect pitch with a max depth of 100 cents. lfo03_freq_lfo01_oncc117=1. 3would make LFO 03 add up to 1. 3 Hertz tothe frequency of LFO 01, with the amount modulated by MIDI CC 117. The avaialble targets related to volume and stereo positioning are:  volume volume_oncc volume_smoothcc volume_stepcc amplitude amplitude_oncc amplitude_smoothcc amplitude_stepcc pan pan_oncc pan_smoothcc pan_stepcc width width_oncc width_smoothcc width_stepccThe targets for pitch modulation are:  pitch pitch_oncc pitch_smoothcc pitch_stepccThe targets for filter modulation are cutoff and resonance, for boththe first and second filter:  cutoff cutoff_oncc cutoff_smoothcc cutoff_stepcc resonance resonance_oncc resonance_smoothcc resonance_stepcc cutoff2 cutoff2_oncc cutoff2_smoothcc cutoff2_stepcc resonance2 resonance2_oncc resonance2_smoothcc resonance2_stepccThe modulations of the EQ bands are:  eqNfreq eqNfreq_oncc eqNfreq_smoothcc eqNfreq_stepcc eqNbw eqNbw_oncc eq1bw_smoothcc eqNbw_stepcc eqNgain eqNgain_oncc eqNgain_smoothcc eqNgain_stepccThe following targets affect other LFOs:  freq_lfoX depth_lfoX depthadd_lfoXSome Cakewalk instruments can also modulate the decim and bitred effects:  decim decim_oncc decim_smoothcc decim_stepcc bitred bitred_oncc bitred_smoothcc bitred_stepccLFO examples: Here is an example of how one LFO could be used to control both pitch vibratoand volume vibrato (tremolo) with the rate, pitch vibrato depth, tremolodepth, delay and fade each controlled by a separate MIDI CC parameter: lfo01_pitch_oncc111=22 // Vibrato LFOlfo01_freq=2lfo01_freq_oncc113=7lfo01_delay_oncc114=0. 500lfo01_fade_oncc115=0. 500lfo01_volume=0 // This LFO also does tremololfo01_volume_oncc112=2And an LFO which does just pitch vibrato, and has a second LFO modulating itsrate to create some unsteadiness: lfo01_pitch_oncc111=22 // Vibrato LFOlfo01_freq=2lfo01_freq_oncc113=7lfo01_delay_oncc114=0. 500lfo01_fade_oncc115=0. 500lfo2_freq_lfo1_oncc116=3  //Affect the rate of the other LFO for unsteady vibratolfo02_wave=1lfo02_freq=0. 1lfo02_freq_oncc116=0. 9For randomized humanization, the extended MIDI CC 135 can be used to randomize theinitial phase and speed of the second LFO. lfo01_pitch_oncc111=22 // Vibrato LFOlfo01_freq=2lfo01_freq_oncc113=7lfo01_delay_oncc114=0. 500lfo01_fade_oncc115=0. 500lfo2_freq_lfo1_oncc116=3  //Affect the rate of the other LFO for unsteady vibratolfo02_wave=1lfo02_freq=0. 1lfo02_freq_oncc116=0. 8lfo02_phase_oncc135=1lfo02_freq_oncc135=0. 2Envelopes: SFZ2 envelopes are numbered and can have an arbitrary number of points, withthe level at each point and its modulation set separately. The opcodes usedto create these envelopes are:  [egN_points] [egN_levelX] [egN_levelX_onccY] [egN_timeX] [egN_timeX_onccY] [egN_shapeX] [egN_curveX] [egN_sustain] [egN_loop]Envelope targets: Similarly to LFOs, envelopes have assignable modulation targets. Thesedestinations are added as a suffix to ‘egN_’ - so, for example: eg01_pitch=2400would have envelope 01 modulate pitch, with an envelope depth of 2400 cents. These are the available targets related to amplitude and stereo positioning:  amplitude amplitude_oncc volume volume_oncc pan pan_oncc width width_onccTargets for pitch:  pitch pitch_onccTargets for filters:  cutoff cutoff_oncc resonance resonance_oncc cutoff2 cutoff2_oncc resonance2 resonance2_onccTargets for EQ bands:  eqNbw eqNbw_oncc eqNfreq eqNfreq_oncc eqNgain eqNgain_onccTargets for modulating LFOs:  depth_lfo depthadd_lfo freq_lfoThese two need to be tested - are they for envelopes to modulate other envelopes?  depth depth_onccTargets for modulating decim and bitred do not appear to have been included in the specification. Example envelope: Here is a simple pitch envelope which will start a note with a glide from up to an octavelower, with the depth and time modulated by MIDI CCs. The envelope will statt at a lowervalue at envelope point 0, and return the pitch to normal at envelope point 1. eg01_sustain=1 //Pitch envelope setup for slideseg01_level0=1eg01_level1=0eg01_time0=0eg01_time1=0eg01_pitch_oncc100=-1200eg01_time1_oncc101=1Using LFOs and envelopes together: Here is an example of using both an envelope and an LFO to modulate pitch, with commondepth and delay parameters. The goal here is asymmetrical pitch vibrato - vibrato whichdoes not go up and down around the original pitch, but instead only goes below it. Thisis idiomatic with saxophones, and is also how vibrato with certain types of non-floatingguitar bridges works (string-bending vibrato is similar, of course, but in the otherdirection). Shifting the phase of LFO01 will make the vibrato waveform start at the top. We also needto lower the pitch by the same amount as the vibrato depth. Using an envelope for thisallows us to delay the onset of the vibrato (again, an important element of idiomaticsaxophone vibrato) without a discontinuous jump in pitch. lfo01_pitch_oncc111=20 //Saxy vibrato LFO - goes down from the main pitchlfo01_freq=2lfo01_freq_oncc112=8lfo01_phase=0. 25 //To make it start at the toplfo01_delay_oncc116=1eg01_pitch_oncc111=20eg01_sustain=1eg01_level0=0eg01_level1=0eg01_level2=-1eg01_time0=0eg01_time1=0eg01_time1_oncc116=1eg01_time2=0Using SFZ1 and SFZ2 modulations together: Both SFZ1 and SFZ2 modulations may be mixed freely. Indeed, it may be simpler to accomplishthe above using the SFZ1 pitch envelope, as it is sufficient in this case, with the SFZ2LFO. Setting the initial phase and modulating the delay with MIDI CC would not be possiblewith the SFZ1 pitch LFO. lfo01_pitch_oncc111=20 //Saxy vibrato LFO - goes down from the main pitchlfo01_freq=2lfo01_freq_oncc112=8lfo01_phase=0. 25 //To make it start at the toplfo01_delay_oncc116=1pitcheg_delay_oncc116=1 //Pitch envelope to drop the central pitch when sax vibrato kicks inpitcheg_depth_oncc111=-20SmoothccN and stepccN: Most MIDI CC modulations, though not all, can have use [smoothccN] and [stepccN]. These work similarly to [bend_smooth] and [bend_step]. SmoothccN adds “inertia” to a modulation, so quickly changing the MIDI CC value has a slower effecton the modulation target than it would normally. StepccN causes the modulation to happen in adiscrete number of steps. Setting the number of steps to 1 would make the modulation anall-or-nothing control. This is what’s possible under the SFZ2 specification. There are some additional modulationsavailable as [ARIA extensions], with [amplitude_onccN] being a very useful one.

However be aware some DAWs smooth the drawn CC automation before it reaches the SFZ player, which means some smoothing will occur regardless of what smoothcc is set to, and any smoothcc smoothing will be applied to those already smoothed control values.

Creating a strum is basically triggering several single-string samples with some of them delayed slightly. Similar but even simpler is a drum flam, which is two drum hits in rapid succession. &lt;region&gt;sample=snare1. wav&lt;region&gt;delay=0. 03sample=snare2. wavBasic Guitar Chord Strum: Here is how an open E major chord could be triggered with a single key: &lt;group&gt;key=40&lt;region&gt;sample=e4. wav&lt;region&gt;delay=0. 02sample=b4. wav&lt;region&gt;delay=0. 04sample=e5. wav&lt;region&gt;delay=0. 06sample=g#4. wav&lt;region&gt;delay=0. 08sample=b4. wav&lt;region&gt;delay=0. 1sample=e6. wavThis is a downward strum - physically the lower strings on a guitar are located higher, so downward strums begin with the lowestnotes. An upstroke would have the same samples but with the delays in reversed order, so it starts with the higest notes. &lt;group&gt;key=40&lt;region&gt;sample=e4. wavdelay=0. 1&lt;region&gt;delay=0. 08sample=b4. wav&lt;region&gt;delay=0. 06sample=e5. wav&lt;region&gt;delay=0. 04sample=g#4. wav&lt;region&gt;delay=0. 02sample=b4. wav&lt;region&gt;sample=e6. wavDifferent Chord Types: An E minor chord would be similar, only with a G instead of the G#. Leaving out the upward strum: &lt;global&gt;sw_lokey=36sw_hikey=37sw_default=36&lt;group&gt;key=40&lt;region&gt;sample=e4. wav&lt;region&gt;delay=0. 02sample=b4. wav&lt;region&gt;delay=0. 04sample=e5. wav//Fourth string is different for major versus minor chords. &lt;region&gt;sw_last=36sw_label=Majordelay=0. 06sample=g#4. wav&lt;region&gt;sw_last=37sw_label=Minordelay=0. 06sample=g4. wav&lt;region&gt;delay=0. 08sample=b4. wav&lt;region&gt;delay=0. 1sample=e6. wavOf course for non-barre chords, there could be differences in voicings for more than one string, but the principleremains the same. The free Emilyguitar instrument located at https://github. com/sfzinstruments/karoryfer. emilyguitar includes a simplestrum patch with keyswitchable power chords, major barre chords and minor barre chords. It has downward strums onlywith a very short strum time. However, it is not well-organized and not at all commented, its patches being justoutput from sfzed. Somewhat more organized and including power chords (which are simply the lowest three strings ofthe barre chord), our E chord might look like this: &lt;global&gt;sw_lokey=36sw_hikey=38sw_default=36&lt;group&gt;key=40//Lowest three strings are the same regardless of keyswitch&lt;region&gt;sample=e4. wav&lt;region&gt;delay=0. 02sample=b4. wav&lt;region&gt;delay=0. 04sample=e5. wav//In order to display the keyswitch label for power chords,//we need a placeholder&lt;group&gt;key=40sw_last=37sw_label=Power&lt;region&gt;sample=*silenceampeg_decay=0ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_release=0//Fourth string is different for major versus minor chords//It is not triggered at all for power chords&lt;group&gt;key=40&lt;region&gt;sw_last=36sw_label=Majordelay=0. 06sample=g#4. wav&lt;region&gt;sw_last=37sw_label=Minordelay=0. 06sample=g4. wav//Top two strings are not triggered for power chords//Duplicated for major and minor keyswitches&lt;group&gt;key=40sw_last=36sw_label=Major&lt;region&gt;delay=0. 08sample=b4. wav&lt;region&gt;delay=0. 1sample=e6. wav&lt;group&gt;key=40sw_last=37sw_label=Minor&lt;region&gt;delay=0. 08sample=b4. wav&lt;region&gt;delay=0. 1sample=e6. wavFor upwards strums, simply reversing the order of delay values would result in the power chords beingdelayed as the e5. wav region would be the first sample triggered, and it would have 0. 006 seconds ofdelay. This would not be good. Therefore, if we want to add upwards strums on lower keyswitches, wemight end up with something like this: &lt;global&gt;sw_lokey=33sw_hikey=38sw_default=36 //Default is major chord, downward strum//Lower three strings for barre chords&lt;group&gt;key=40sw_last=35sw_label=Major Up&lt;region&gt;sample=e4. wavdelay=0. 1&lt;region&gt;delay=0. 08sample=b4. wav&lt;region&gt;delay=0. 06sample=e5. wav&lt;group&gt;key=40sw_last=34sw_label=Minor Up&lt;region&gt;sample=e4. wavdelay=0. 1&lt;region&gt;delay=0. 08sample=b4. wav&lt;region&gt;delay=0. 06sample=e5. wav//Lower three strings for power chords&lt;group&gt;key=40sw_last=33sw_label=Power Up&lt;region&gt;sample=e4. wavdelay=0. 04&lt;region&gt;delay=0. 02sample=b4. wav&lt;region&gt;sample=e5. wav//Fourth string is different for major versus minor chords//It is not triggered at all for power chords&lt;group&gt;key=40&lt;region&gt;sw_last=35sw_label=Major Updelay=0. 004sample=g#4. wav&lt;region&gt;sw_last=34sw_label=Minor Updelay=0. 004sample=g4. wav//Top two strings are not triggered for power chords//Duplicated for major and minor keyswitches&lt;group&gt;key=40sw_last=35sw_label=Major Up&lt;region&gt;delay=0. 02sample=b4. wav&lt;region&gt;sample=e6. wav&lt;group&gt;key=40sw_last=34sw_label=Minor up&lt;region&gt;delay=0. 02sample=b4. wav&lt;region&gt;sample=e6. wavDepending on needs, this might not be worth implementing, as duplicaton of regions adds to the timerequired for many SFZ players (certainly ARIA/sforzando) to parse and open an instrument. It is,however, certainly possible. Adjusting Time: The above strums all have a fixed duration. Adjusting strum time is easily done by replacing thefixed delay with a modulated one. Going back to the simple E major example for brevity’s sake: &lt;group&gt;key=40&lt;region&gt;sample=e4. wav&lt;region&gt;delay_cc1=0. 2sample=b4. wav&lt;region&gt;delay_cc1=0. 4sample=e5. wav&lt;region&gt;delay_cc1=0. 6sample=g#4. wav&lt;region&gt;delay_cc1=0. 8sample=b4. wav&lt;region&gt;delay_cc1=1sample=e6. wavIt would also be easy to add a small random delay to each voice. However, because delay is not anavailable target for the var modulator, it is not possible to have an adjustable amount ofrandomization, or make the random amount smaller when the CC adjusting the non-random delay is low. This means adding a simple delay_random to each voice would create the risk of “earlier” notesactually sounding after “later” ones when the non-random delay is close to zero. However, makingthe delay partially fixed and partially adjustable avoids this. &lt;group&gt;key=40&lt;region&gt;sample=e4. wav&lt;region&gt;delay=0. 01delay_cc1=0. 2delay_random=0. 01sample=b4. wav&lt;region&gt;delay=0. 02delay_cc1=0. 4delay_random=0. 01sample=e5. wav&lt;region&gt;delay=0. 03delay_cc1=0. 6delay_random=0. 01sample=g#4. wav&lt;region&gt;delay=0. 04delay_cc1=0. 8delay_random=0. 01sample=b4. wav&lt;region&gt;delay=0. 05delay_cc1=1delay_random=0. 01sample=e6. wavRinging And Muting: With the above examples, the samples will play until a note-off message, then follow the usual ampenvelope release. In reality, the strings will often ring until the string is hit again, and itcan be more convenient to have the samples always play in their entirety unless muted: &lt;global&gt;loop_mode=one_shot&lt;group&gt;key=40&lt;region&gt;sample=e4. wavgroup=6off_by=6&lt;region&gt;delay_cc1=0. 2sample=b4. wavgroup=5off_by=5&lt;region&gt;delay_cc1=0. 4sample=e5. wavgroup=4off_by=4&lt;region&gt;delay_cc1=0. 6sample=g#4. wavgroup=3off_by=3&lt;region&gt;delay_cc1=0. 8sample=b4. wavgroup=2off_by=2&lt;region&gt;delay_cc1=1sample=e6. wavgroup=1off_by=1Note that a new strum will mute all strings, without waiting for their delay for that specific string to be completed. There is currently elegant solution known for this. Using a longer off time or triggering a release sample could be possible workarounds to fill the sonic gap, though. On the positive side, a partial strum that does not hit all thestrings would let the other strings keep ringing. If one shot mode is used, it’s probably also useful to allow for quickly muting all strings when desired. That can bedone with a placeholder region for each string, and combining those regions on another key, here one above theoctave of the strums. &lt;group&gt;key=60ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_release=0&lt;region&gt;sample=*silencegroup=6off_by=6&lt;region&gt;sample=*silencegroup=5off_by=5&lt;region&gt;sample=*silencegroup=4off_by=4&lt;region&gt;sample=*silencegroup=3off_by=3&lt;region&gt;sample=*silencegroup=2off_by=2&lt;region&gt;sample=*silencegroup=1off_by=1Harp Glissandi: Harp glissandi could be set up very similarly to a guitar strum, only with potentially a lot more notes. For simplicty’s sake, let’s consider just one octave. Speed is still controlled by CC1, and MIDI note24 will trigger an upward glissando starting with the C4 note. &lt;group&gt;key=24&lt;region&gt;sample=c4. wav&lt;region&gt;sample=d4. wavdelay_cc1=0. 1&lt;region&gt;sample=e4. wavdelay_cc1=0. 2&lt;region&gt;sample=f4. wavdelay_cc1=0. 3&lt;region&gt;sample=g4. wavdelay_cc1=0. 4&lt;region&gt;sample=a4. wavdelay_cc1=0. 5&lt;region&gt;sample=b4. wavdelay_cc1=0. 6&lt;region&gt;sample=c5. wavdelay_cc1=0. 7In order to make this more usable, we can add another control which will determine for how many notesthe gliss keeps going before it stops. Let’s use CC4. &lt;group&gt;key=24//First three notes are not affected by CC4, and are always played&lt;region&gt;sample=c4. wav&lt;region&gt;sample=d4. wavdelay_cc1=0. 1&lt;region&gt;sample=e4. wavdelay_cc1=0. 2&lt;region&gt;sample=f4. wavdelay_cc1=0. 3locc4=1&lt;region&gt;sample=g4. wavdelay_cc1=0. 4locc4=32&lt;region&gt;sample=a4. wavdelay_cc1=0. 5locc4=64&lt;region&gt;sample=b4. wavdelay_cc1=0. 6locc4=96&lt;region&gt;sample=c5. wavdelay_cc1=0. 7locc4=127This is essentially how a harp glissando on a folk harp operates. Concert harps have pedals whichallow the retuning of strings to allow playing other scales, and this would need to be implemented,perhaps with a different MIDI CC for each pitch class. Strumming the drone strings on a Hungarianzither also works essentially as described here. Lyres And Zithers: Many folk lyres, guslis etc. are tuned diatonically and chords on those are played by muting somestrings, and strumming across both the open and muted strings. Keyswitches in another octave couldbe added to mute the strings, so that samples are only played when the switch matching that string isdown. This basically works like a harp gliss, but the samples for the muted strings are not played. The keyswitches will not be displayed on the keyboard by most sfz players, so it will also likelybe necessary to add some placeholder regions just to make them display. It’s also common to strum across fewer than all the strings; this is basically what the powerchord in the above guitar examples is. Instead of keyswitching, it is also possible to have partialstrums on different keys (though this can easily require more keys than an 88-key keyboard),or selectable by CC, note velocity and possibly other variables as well. The below example usesCC4 to control how many strings are strummed. &lt;group&gt;key=24//First three notes are not affected by CC4&lt;region&gt;sample=c4. wavsw_down=36&lt;region&gt;sample=d4. wavdelay_cc1=0. 1sw_down=38&lt;region&gt;sample=e4. wavdelay_cc1=0. 2sw_down=40&lt;region&gt;sample=f4. wavdelay_cc1=0. 3sw_down=41locc4=1&lt;region&gt;sample=g4. wavdelay_cc1=0. 4sw_down=43locc4=32&lt;region&gt;sample=a4. wavdelay_cc1=0. 5sw_down=45locc4=64&lt;region&gt;sample=b4. wavdelay_cc1=0. 6sw_down=47locc4=96&lt;region&gt;sample=c5. wavdelay_cc1=0. 7sw_down=48locc4=127//Placeholders to get the switch keys to be visible&lt;group&gt;sample=*silenceampeg_decay=0ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_release=0&lt;region&gt;key=36&lt;region&gt;key=38&lt;region&gt;key=40&lt;region&gt;key=41&lt;region&gt;key=43&lt;region&gt;key=45&lt;region&gt;key=47&lt;region&gt;key=48For more realism, muted samples could be triggered for the strings which are not down. Although muting the strings for the keyswitches which are up and skipping the strings where theswitch is down would be more analogous to the way the instruments are played in real life, thissort of “negative space” chord fingering is much more awkward for most users to play on a keyboard. It could easily be accomplished by merely switching the sw_up and sw_down opcodes in the belowexample. &lt;group&gt;key=24//Ringing strings//First three notes are not affected by CC4&lt;region&gt;sample=c4. wavsw_down=36&lt;region&gt;sample=d4. wavdelay_cc1=0. 1sw_down=38&lt;region&gt;sample=e4. wavdelay_cc1=0. 2sw_down=40&lt;region&gt;sample=f4. wavdelay_cc1=0. 3sw_down=41locc4=1&lt;region&gt;sample=g4. wavdelay_cc1=0. 4sw_down=43locc4=32&lt;region&gt;sample=a4. wavdelay_cc1=0. 5sw_down=45locc4=64&lt;region&gt;sample=b4. wavdelay_cc1=0. 6sw_down=47locc4=96&lt;region&gt;sample=c5. wavdelay_cc1=0. 7sw_down=48locc4=127//Muted strings//First three notes are not affected by CC4&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_muted. wavsw_up=36&lt;region&gt;sample=d4_muted. wavdelay_cc1=0. 1sw_up=38&lt;region&gt;sample=e4_muted. wavdelay_cc1=0. 2sw_up=40&lt;region&gt;sample=f4_muted. wavdelay_cc1=0. 3sw_up=41locc4=1&lt;region&gt;sample=g4_muted. wavdelay_cc1=0. 4sw_up=43locc4=32&lt;region&gt;sample=a4_muted. wavdelay_cc1=0. 5sw_up=45locc4=64&lt;region&gt;sample=b4_muted. wavdelay_cc1=0. 6sw_up=47locc4=96&lt;region&gt;sample=c5_muted. wavdelay_cc1=0. 7sw_up=48locc4=127//Placeholders to get the switch keys to be visible&lt;group&gt;sample=*silenceampeg_decay=0ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_release=0&lt;region&gt;key=36&lt;region&gt;key=38&lt;region&gt;key=40&lt;region&gt;key=41&lt;region&gt;key=43&lt;region&gt;key=45&lt;region&gt;key=47&lt;region&gt;key=48Chromatic Strumming On Diatonic Instruments: The cithara barbarica instrument at https://github. com/sfzinstruments/cithara-barbarica has a patch like this. It simply duplicates each string’s regions to cover the “missing” pitches. This works fine as long as there areno muted samples used for the stopped strings, and having a muted string sound every half-step would not beidiomatic for instruments other than the very rare chromatic gusli. One way to have muted sounds while playing chromatically would be to always trigger a muted sound for whateverthe “real” pitch of each string should be, but have it instantly muted if a pitch in that string’s range isplayed. This is not great, as the muted sound would be a half-step off, but as the muted strings are shortenedand produce a higher pitch anyway, it seems to work well enough. &lt;group&gt;key=26//Muted regions, each with its own group and off_by&lt;region&gt;sample=d4_muted. wavgroup=11off_by=21&lt;region&gt;sample=e4_muted. wavgroup=12off_by=22delay_cc1=0. 100&lt;region&gt;sample=f4_muted. wavgroup=13off_by=23delay_cc1=0. 200//Non-muted regions, with groups that will mute the above regions if one of the keys covered by that sample is held down&lt;region&gt;sample=d4_finger. wavsw_down=36group=21transpose=-2&lt;region&gt;sample=d4_finger. wavsw_down=37group=21transpose=-1&lt;region&gt;sample=d4_finger. wavsw_down=38group=21&lt;region&gt;sample=e4_finger. wavsw_down=39group=22transpose=-1delay_cc1=0. 100&lt;region&gt;sample=e4_finger. wavsw_down=40group=22delay_cc1=0. 100&lt;region&gt;sample=f4_finger. wavsw_down=41group=23delay_cc1=0. 200A more realistic way to handle this would be to have a MIDI CC for each string to set its tuning, so for examplethe C string could sound a B or C# note, like on a concert harp with pedals. However, this is probably not veryconvenient for most players who would rather hit a B note to sound a B. This, of course, would not actually bechromatic - but not limited to a single scale. Further Possibilities: In reality, a strum will transfer force to the first strings it hits, and subsequent strings willbe hit with a little less force, and the delay between strings might also be nonlinear.

    "title": "Subtractive synthesizers",
    "body": "Introduction: This tutorial describes implementing typical subtractive synthesizermodulations - filters, envelopes and LFOs - in SFZ. It uses theCaveman Cosmonaut instrument by Karoryfer Samples as an example. Thisdoes not cover all modulations used in classic hardware subtractivesynths, but it’s a start. Basic amplifier envelope: Though subtractive synths get their name from having frequenciessubtracted from the sound by filter, the volume envelope is probablythe most fundamental modulation. Here is an [AHDSR envelope] including[‹control›] parameter labels and defaults. &lt;control&gt;label_cc100=Attack timelabel_cc101=Hold timelabel_cc102=Decay timelabel_cc103=Sustain levellabel_cc104=Release timeset_cc102=63set_cc103=51set_cc104=31&lt;global&gt;//AHDSRampeg_attack=0. 002ampeg_sustain=0ampeg_release=0. 002ampeg_attack_oncc100=0. 5ampeg_hold_oncc101=1ampeg_decay_oncc102=5ampeg_sustain_oncc103=100ampeg_release_oncc104=2An ADSR envelope would simple leave out the [hold] stage control,leaving the default hold time of zero. Further envelope possibilities: The above envelope will affect all sounds, as it’s set at the globallevel. In many classic synths, it’s possible to have separateenvelopes modulating the volume of different oscillators, forexample using a shorter envelope to turn a noise oscillator intoa short transient. If more envelope stages are required, an [SFZ2 envelope] with anarbitrary amount of points can be used to modulate amplitudeinstead of the SFZ1 envelope above. In the ARIA SFZ player, amplifier envelope durations are calculatedonce on trigger, which means changing envelope parameters other thansustain and release while a note is playing will not change the sound. The [ampeg_dynamic] opcode could be set to 1 in order to recalculateenvelope parameters every time one of the control parameters receivesa MIDI message, which could be closer to the behavior of mostanalog synthesizer hardware. Caveman Cosmonaut has a more unusual parameter called Env Soften,which has no effect on some oscillators which have morehigh-frequency content, and adds to the release and decay timesof the warmer-sounding oscillators. This is highly unusual, butcan be musically useful for things such as plucks, as the warmersounds linger longer. This is similar to the effect of releaseor decay on a lowpass filter cutoff, but perhaps a little moreorganic. That’s set per oscillator, rather than globally, likethis, with CC 18 selecting the oscillator, and CC 106 being theenvelope soften: &lt;master&gt;locc18=11hicc18=20ampeg_decay_oncc106=1. 25ampeg_release_oncc106=0. 7#include  mappings/unitra_flutes. sfz &lt;master&gt;locc18=21hicc18=30ampeg_decay_oncc106=1ampeg_release_oncc106=0. 4#include  mappings/unitra_clarinet. sfz &lt;master&gt;locc18=31hicc18=40ampeg_decay_oncc106=1. 5ampeg_release_oncc106=0. 6#include  mappings/unitra_trombone. sfz &lt;master&gt;locc18=41hicc18=50ampeg_decay_oncc106=0. 5ampeg_release_oncc106=0. 2#include  mappings/unitra_trompette. sfz &lt;master&gt;locc18=51hicc18=60ampeg_decay_oncc106=1. 25ampeg_release_oncc106=0. 5#include  mappings/unitra_violin. sfz &lt;master&gt;locc18=61hicc18=70#include  mappings/unitra_tremolo. sfz &lt;master&gt;locc18=71#include  mappings/unitra_all. sfz Basic filter: The filter in the example instrument is a single [lowpass] filterwith [cutoff] and [resonance] controls, adjustable [velocity] tracking using[var] a two-stage [filter cutoff envelope]. &lt;control&gt;label_cc120=Filter cutofflabel_cc121=Resonancelabel_cc124=Veltracklabel_cc125=Plucklabel_cc126=Filter attacklabel_cc127=Filter decayset_cc120=127set_cc127=40&lt;global&gt;//Lowpass filtercutoff=250cutoff_cc120=9600fil_keytrack=100resonance=0resonance_cc121=18var01_cutoff=6000 //Velocity trackvar01_mod=multvar01_oncc131=1var01_oncc124=1cutoff_cc124=-3000//Pluck envelopefileg_depth=0fileg_depthcc125=8400fileg_sustain=0fileg_attack=0fileg_attackcc126=0. 5fileg_decay=0. 001fileg_decaycc127=2Filter keytracking: Making the filter cutoff keytrack is a simple matter ofsetting the [fil_keytrack] to 100; however, things getmore complicated if filter keytracking is not desired. Although fil_keytrack can be set to 0 and the basefilter cutoff will then not keytrack, the filter cutoffmodulation in SFZ is specified in cents, not Hertz. Thismeans the amount of the cutoff which is modulated willkeytrack, regardless of what fil_keytrack is set to. Thisisn’t a big issue with most synthesizers, but when tryingto make an adjustable highpass filter for all pieces ofa drum kit except the kick, for example, it can makethings complicated. Adjusting keytracking for the modulated amount requiresusing var and the extended CC 133 (MIDI key number). Var and extended CCs are already used above for thevelocity tracking on the filter cutoff. The example instrumenthas a somewhat convoluted and unusual configuration forthe filter keytracking, where when CC 120 has a veryhigh value, the cutoff will be slightly above 22. 05 kHzfor all keys in the instrument’s range, while the cutoffwhen CC 120 is at zero has 70% keytracking. This is notat all standard, and means the base cutoff has moderatepositive keytracking while the cutoff modulation hasnegative keytracking. //By default, cutoff modulation is measured in cents//To make the modulation not keytrack, we make a kludge//Using varcutoff=250var02_cutoff=9000var02_mod=multvar02_oncc120=1var02_curvecc120=0var02_oncc133=1var02_curvecc133=11fil_keytrack=70At the end of the SFZ file, the [‹curve›] is then specified: &lt;curve&gt;curve_index=11v000=1v024=1v084=0. 63v127=0. 25More filter possibilities: It would be easy to have more filter envelope stages; onlyattack and decay are used above to keep things simple, asthose parameters are enough to create basic plucks (zeroattack, moderate decay) and 303 style basses (slightlylonger attack, moderate decay). Using fil2_type and cutoff2 allows two filters in series,for example a lowpass and highpass filter. Fil_type canalso be used to choose different filter types, perhaps with[locc/hicc]. Modulating the filter cutoff with LFOs is added below, in thevibrato section. Vibrato: Vibrato can affect pitch, volume (for tremolo) and filter cutoff(for wobble). Here is a typical setup using one [LFO] to modulateall three. &lt;control&gt;label_cc111=Vibrato to pitchlabel_cc112=Vibrato speedlabel_cc113=Vibrato to cutofflabel_cc114=Vibrato to volumelabel_cc115=Vibrato delaylabel_cc116=Vibrato fadeset_cc112=40&lt;global&gt;lfo01_pitch_oncc111=22 //Vibrato LFOlfo01_freq=0. 1lfo01_freq_oncc112=9. 9lfo01_delay_oncc115=0. 500lfo01_fade_oncc116=0. 500lfo01_volume_oncc114=6//Wobblelfo01_cutoff=0lfo01_cutoff_oncc113=3600Humanized vibrato: Humanization is obviously not a standard feature of synthesizers. Technically, though, it’s not difficult to implement. The example instrument adds CC 117 for controlling theamount of randomizationof the vibrato LFOs. This is similar to the humanizationdescribed in the [vibrato tutorial], but using CC 135 togenerate a true random number for each voice, whichmeans any unison voices’ vibrato will drift out of syncwith those belonging to other voices. This is musicallyuseful for creating more complex pads, for example. Similarprinciples could also be used to emulate analog oscillators’much more subtle pitch drift. &lt;control&gt;label_cc111=Vibrato to pitchlabel_cc112=Vibrato speedlabel_cc113=Vibrato to cutofflabel_cc114=Vibrato to volumelabel_cc115=Vibrato delaylabel_cc116=Vibrato fadelabel_cc117=Vibrato humanizeset_cc112=40&lt;global&gt;//Vibrato and humanization setuplfo01_pitch_oncc111=22 //Vibrato LFOlfo01_freq=0. 1lfo01_freq_oncc112=9. 9lfo01_delay_oncc115=0. 500lfo01_fade_oncc116=0. 500lfo01_volume_oncc114=6//Wobblelfo01_cutoff=0lfo01_cutoff_oncc113=3600lfo02_wave=1 //Second LFO to make things wobblierlfo02_phase=0lfo02_phase_oncc135=1 //Phase randomizedlfo02_freq=0. 01 //Basically no movement at very slow speeds, just randomizationlfo02_freq_oncc117=1 //Max rate is not very high, so it doesn't sound too obviouslfo02_pitch_oncc117=6 //Slight pitch wobblinesslfo02_freq_lfo01_oncc117=0. 5 //Affect the rate of the other LFO for unsteady vibratolfo02_freq_lfo01_oncc112=2. 5 //Faster when the first LFO is going fasterlfo03_wave=1 //And a third LFO for secondhand complex wobblinesslfo03_phase=0. 4lfo03_phase_oncc135=0. 179 //Different phase response to random than the second LFOlfo03_freq=0. 5lfo03_freq_oncc117=-0. 4lfo03_freq_lfo2_oncc117=1lfo03_pitch_oncc117=-4lfo04_wave=1 //Fourth LFO for slowly changing the oscillator mixlfo04_phase_oncc135=1lfo04_freq=0. 01lfo04_freq_oncc135=0. 25 //Randomly from almost not moving at all to still pretty slowlfo04_volume_oncc117=1. 5 //Slight volume changesUnison and detune: Unison is a simple matter of triggering multiple regionswith one MIDI note. If using a simple sound source suchas a saw oscillators, all regions will sound identical sothe only result will be additional volume. Making theunison more interesting requires some of: using differentsamples for each voice, detuning the voices, and shiftingthe phase of the voices. The example instrument uses many sets of samples from ananalog keyboard, with every key producing a slightlydifferent timbre, and transposed versions of those soundsused for unison. The [detune] and width amounts vary foreach of the three oscillators, but here is a simplifiedversion assuming there is only one oscillator. Note that although there is a [width] opcodes foruse with stereo samples, in this case the left channel and right areseparate mono samples, so [pan] is used to spread themin stereo - not width. As the samples here are quite long, [offset_random]is applied globally to effecitvely randomize each voice’s phase. Withtrue single-cycle waveforms, the max offset would have to be set tomatch each voice’s max sample length. &lt;control&gt;label_cc25=Unisonlabel_cc26=Widthlabel_cc27=Detuneset_cc26=63set_cc27=63&lt;global&gt;//Randomizing the start points of the samples to randomize phaseoffset_random=1000//Center voice&lt;master&gt;#include  sample_map_basic. sfz //Left voice&lt;region&gt;amplitude_cc25=100amplitude_cc25=100locc25=1pan_cc26=-100tune_cc27=-33#include  sample_map_transposed_1. sfz //Right voice&lt;region&gt;amplitude_cc25=100locc25=1pan_cc26=100tune_cc27=33amplitude_cc25=100#include  sample_map_transposed_2. sfz More complex detune: Another highly unsual feature of Caveman Cosmonaut, though, isthat the detune doesn’t have to be fixed. There are additionaldetune controls which detune the additional voices more at thestart of the note, and then drift towards a common pitch overtime, using [pitch envelopes]. This is definitely not part ofany typical hardware analog synthesizer’s feature set, but itdoes have something in common with the way real world choirsor instrumental ensembles find a commmon pitch. &lt;control&gt;label_cc25=Unisonlabel_cc26=Widthlabel_cc27=Detunelabel_cc28=Extra detune amtlabel_cc29=Extra detune timeset_cc26=63set_cc27=63set_cc29=16&lt;global&gt;//Randomizing the start points of the samples to randomize phaseoffset_random=1000//Pitch envelope defaults for the fancy detunepitcheg_sustain=0pitcheg_decay_shape=-2//Center voice&lt;master&gt;#include  sample_map_basic. sfz //Left voice&lt;region&gt;amplitude_cc25=100locc25=1pan_cc26=-100tune_cc27=-33pitcheg_depth_oncc28=-150pitcheg_decay_oncc29=5#include  sample_map_transposed_1. sfz //Right voice&lt;region&gt;amplitude_cc25=100locc25=1pan_cc26=100tune_cc27=33pitcheg_depth_oncc28=150pitcheg_decay_oncc29=5#include  sample_map_transposed_2. sfz Waveform selection and oscillator mixing: This is just locc/hicc for selection, and [amplitude] for volumecontrols.

Default is 0. 5, meaning the sustain pedal is down as long as the CC value isanything above 0. To make the pedal only act as “down” past the halfway point,set this to 64 - then the pedal is considered “up” from CC value 0 to 63,and “down” from 64 to 127. Leaving this at the default value of 1, or setting itto some other low number such as 10, is useful when the piano supportshalf-pedaling. Setting it to 64 is preferred by some users who want to use thesustain pedal as an on/off sustain switch for instruments with no half-pedaling. Please note that the direction of the MIDI CC values is normally from 0 at thetop of the pedal to 127 when it is at the bottom, meaning that physically “down”on the pedal is up in terms of MIDI CC value. It is possible to set this to different values for different regions, so thatfor example mechanical noises and notes will not be affected by the sustain pedalin the same way.

    "body": "We’ve covered the basic opcodes required to map simple drum instruments onanother page, and here we are going to apply thatknowledge to pitched instruments, plus add more opcodes. Let’s say we want tosample a folk flute whose lowest note is a D. If the lowest five notes areD, E, F#, G and A, and there is one sample available for each note, they couldbe mapped like this: &lt;region&gt;key=50 sample=d4. wav&lt;region&gt;key=52 sample=e4. wav&lt;region&gt;key=54 sample=f#4. wav&lt;region&gt;key=55 sample=g4. wav&lt;region&gt;key=57 sample=a4. wavThis would work well enough to make a sound when a MIDI note corresponding toone of the sampled pitches is played. However, playing notes inbetweenthe D and E, or E and F#, would mean no sound. We can “stretch” one of theneighboring notes to cover that D# and that F using the[lokey / hikey] and [pitch_keycenter] opcodes instead of key. If a sample does not need to cover multiple notes, it can still use key. Whetherto use the D or E sample to cover the D# in our example is a judgment call -which sounds better? &lt;region&gt;lokey=50 hikey=51 pitch_keycenter=50 sample=d4. wav&lt;region&gt;lokey=52 hikey=53 pitch_keycenter=52 sample=e4. wav&lt;region&gt;key=54 sample=f#4. wav&lt;region&gt;lokey=55 hikey=55 pitch_keycenter=56 sample=g4. wav&lt;region&gt;key=57 sample=a4. wavThe samples will play as long as a note is held, but when the note is released,they will end suddenly, which is probably not realistic for a flute sound, orindeed most other instruments. We’ll need to apply a volume envelope with arelease time set, which can be applied to all regions. The [ampeg_release] opcode accomplishes this. &lt;global&gt;ampeg_release=0. 3&lt;region&gt;lokey=50 hikey=51 pitch_keycenter=50 sample=d4. wav&lt;region&gt;lokey=52 hikey=53 pitch_keycenter=52 sample=e4. wav&lt;region&gt;key=54 sample=f#4. wav&lt;region&gt;key=55 sample=g4. wavIf we have samples at various dynamics, such as quiet and loud, we could usenote velocity to choose which sample is played - however, while this makesperfect sense for drum hits or piano notes, with instruments such as flute orviolin, it’s possible for the player to vary the dynamic level while a note isbeing sustained. This can be simulated with the[xfin_loccN / xfin_hiccN] and [xfout_loccN / xfout_hiccN] opcodes. Using only theD4 and E4 samples as an example, and controlling the dynamics with CC1 (mod wheel). The [amp_veltrack] opcode is set to 0, so that velocity does not affect volume. &lt;global&gt;ampeg_release=0. 3 amp_veltrack=0&lt;group&gt;lokey=50 hikey=51 pitch_keycenter=50&lt;region&gt;sample=d4_p. wav xfin_locc1=0 xfin_hicc1=42 xfout_locc1=43 xfout_hicc1=85&lt;region&gt;sample=d4_mf. wav xfin_locc1=43 xfin_hicc1=85 xfout_locc1=86 xfout_hicc1=127&lt;region&gt;sample=d4_f. wav xfin_locc1=86 xfin_hicc1=127&lt;group&gt;lokey=52 hikey=53 pitch_keycenter=52&lt;region&gt;sample=e4_p. wav xfin_locc1=0 xfin_hicc1=42 xfout_locc1=43 xfout_hicc1=85&lt;region&gt;sample=e4_mf. wav xfin_locc1=43 xfin_hicc1=85 xfout_locc1=86 xfout_hicc1=127&lt;region&gt;sample=e4_f. wav xfin_locc1=86 xfin_hicc1=127Now, CC1 would first fade in the quiet sample when it was between 0 and 42. From 43 to 85, the quiet sample is faded out and the medium sample faded in. From 86 to the max value of 127, the medium sample is faded out while the loudsample fades in. If we have multiple techniques or articulation sampled, forexample regular sustains and fluttertongue sustains, we need a way to switchbetween them. Each could be its own independent and complete SFZ file, and wecould just load the desired file into the player, but for convenience,especially in live performance, it’s good to load both at once and have a way ofswitching between them. One way is [loccN / hiccN] where which sample is triggeredfor a particular note depends on the value of a MIDI CC - let’s use MIDI CC 11. Notice that the fluttertongue samples in this example have fewer dynamic layersthan the main sustain samples - it’s common for the “core” articulations of aninstrument to be sampled in more detail, and the SFZ format is flexible enoughto allow this, or even allow different amounts of dynamic layers or round robinsfor different notes within the same articulation. &lt;global&gt;ampeg_release=0. 3 amp_veltrack=0&lt;group&gt;lokey=50 hikey=51 pitch_keycenter=50 hicc11=63&lt;region&gt;sample=d4_p. wav xfin_locc1=0 xfin_hicc1=42 xfout_locc1=43 xfout_hicc1=85&lt;region&gt;sample=d4_mf. wav xfin_locc1=43 xfin_hicc1=85 xfout_locc1=86 xfout_hicc1=127&lt;region&gt;sample=d4_f. wav xfin_locc1=86 xfin_hicc1=127&lt;group&gt;lokey=52 hikey=53 pitch_keycenter=52 hicc11=63&lt;region&gt;sample=e4_p. wav xfin_locc1=0 xfin_hicc1=42 xfout_locc1=43 xfout_hicc1=85&lt;region&gt;sample=e4_mf. wav xfin_locc1=43 xfin_hicc1=85 xfout_locc1=86 xfout_hicc1=127&lt;region&gt;sample=e4_f. wav xfin_locc1=86 xfin_hicc1=127&lt;group&gt;lokey=50 hikey=51 pitch_keycenter=50 locc11=64&lt;region&gt;sample=d4_ft_p. wav xfin_locc1=0 xfin_hicc1=63 xfout_locc1=64 xfout_hicc1=127&lt;region&gt;sample=d4_ft_f. wav xfin_locc1=64 xfin_hicc1=127&lt;group&gt;lokey=52 hikey=53 pitch_keycenter=52 locc11=64&lt;region&gt;sample=e4_ft_p. wav xfin_locc1=0 xfin_hicc1=63 xfout_locc1=64 xfout_hicc1=127&lt;region&gt;sample=e4_ft_f. wav xfin_locc1=64 xfin_hicc1=127Another, probably more common, way is to use keyswitches. If we define thekeyswitch range as the C and C# below our lowest D using[sw_lokey / sw_hikey], we can then use [sw_last] to select articulations. &lt;global&gt;ampeg_release=0. 3 amp_veltrack=0 sw_lokey=48 sw_hikey=49&lt;group&gt;lokey=50 hikey=51 pitch_keycenter=50 sw_last=48&lt;region&gt;sample=d4_p. wav xfin_locc1=0 xfin_hicc1=42 xfout_locc1=43 xfout_hicc1=85&lt;region&gt;sample=d4_mf. wav xfin_locc1=43 xfin_hicc1=85 xfout_locc1=86 xfout_hicc1=127&lt;region&gt;sample=d4_f. wav xfin_locc1=86 xfin_hicc1=127&lt;group&gt;lokey=52 hikey=53 pitch_keycenter=52 sw_last=48&lt;region&gt;sample=e4_p. wav xfin_locc1=0 xfin_hicc1=42 xfout_locc1=43 xfout_hicc1=85&lt;region&gt;sample=e4_mf. wav xfin_locc1=43 xfin_hicc1=85 xfout_locc1=86 xfout_hicc1=127&lt;region&gt;sample=e4_f. wav xfin_locc1=86 xfin_hicc1=127&lt;group&gt;lokey=50 hikey=51 pitch_keycenter=50 sw_last=49&lt;region&gt;sample=d4_ft_p. wav xfin_locc1=0 xfin_hicc1=63 xfout_locc1=64 xfout_hicc1=127&lt;region&gt;sample=d4_ft_f. wav xfin_locc1=64 xfin_hicc1=127&lt;group&gt;lokey=52 hikey=53 pitch_keycenter=52 sw_last=49&lt;region&gt;sample=e4_ft_p. wav xfin_locc1=0 xfin_hicc1=63 xfout_locc1=64 xfout_hicc1=127&lt;region&gt;sample=e4_ft_f. wav xfin_locc1=64 xfin_hicc1=127There are other possibilities - for example, since velocity is not needed tocontrol dynamics, we could use that to select articulations using[lovel / hivel], for example. However, it’ is quite common,especially with string instruments, to use a MIDI CC to control the dynamics ofsustained articulations, and velocity to control the dynamics of shortarticulations such as staccato. In those cases, the short articulations coulduse amp_veltrack set to 100 instead of 0, and generally be mapped in the sameway as the drums we’ve discussed before. The flute isa monophonic instrument in reality - you can’t play chords on it, while you canusing our SFZ here. For more realism, playing a note on this flute should muteany previously playing notes. To make an instrument which can only play one noteat a time, the [group] and [off_by] opcodes can be used. Although these can be used in more complex scenarios, for amonophonic instrument with no multiple microphone positions sampled, it’s enoughto put all samples in the same group, and have that group muted whenever a newnote from that group is played. &lt;global&gt;ampeg_release=0. 3 amp_veltrack=0 sw_lokey=48 sw_hikey=49 group=1 off_by=1&lt;group&gt;lokey=50 hikey=51 pitch_keycenter=50 sw_last=48&lt;region&gt;sample=d4_p. wav xfin_locc1=0 xfin_hicc1=42 xfout_locc1=43 xfout_hicc1=85&lt;region&gt;sample=d4_mf. wav xfin_locc1=43 xfin_hicc1=85 xfout_locc1=86 xfout_hicc1=127&lt;region&gt;sample=d4_f. wav xfin_locc1=86 xfin_hicc1=127&lt;group&gt;lokey=52 hikey=53 pitch_keycenter=52 sw_last=48&lt;region&gt;sample=e4_p. wav xfin_locc1=0 xfin_hicc1=42 xfout_locc1=43 xfout_hicc1=85&lt;region&gt;sample=e4_mf. wav xfin_locc1=43 xfin_hicc1=85 xfout_locc1=86 xfout_hicc1=127&lt;region&gt;sample=e4_f. wav xfin_locc1=86 xfin_hicc1=127&lt;group&gt;lokey=50 hikey=51 pitch_keycenter=50 sw_last=49&lt;region&gt;sample=d4_ft_p. wav xfin_locc1=0 xfin_hicc1=63 xfout_locc1=64 xfout_hicc1=127&lt;region&gt;sample=d4_ft_f. wav xfin_locc1=64 xfin_hicc1=127&lt;group&gt;lokey=52 hikey=53 pitch_keycenter=52 sw_last=49&lt;region&gt;sample=e4_ft_p. wav xfin_locc1=0 xfin_hicc1=63 xfout_locc1=64 xfout_hicc1=127&lt;region&gt;sample=e4_ft_f. wav xfin_locc1=64 xfin_hicc1=127However, this cuts off the note suddenly, creating a gap before the next notecan reach full volume. That problem can be fixed by setting [off_mode]to normal, which will make the notes being muted fade out gradually over theduration previously specified with the ampeg_release opcode. &lt;global&gt;ampeg_release=0. 3 amp_veltrack=0 sw_lokey=48 sw_hikey=49group=1 off_by=1 off_mode=normal&lt;group&gt;lokey=50 hikey=51 pitch_keycenter=50 sw_last=48&lt;region&gt;sample=d4_p. wav xfin_locc1=0 xfin_hicc1=42 xfout_locc1=43 xfout_hicc1=85&lt;region&gt;sample=d4_mf. wav xfin_locc1=43 xfin_hicc1=85 xfout_locc1=86 xfout_hicc1=127&lt;region&gt;sample=d4_f. wav xfin_locc1=86 xfin_hicc1=127&lt;group&gt;lokey=52 hikey=53 pitch_keycenter=52 sw_last=48&lt;region&gt;sample=e4_p. wav xfin_locc1=0 xfin_hicc1=42 xfout_locc1=43 xfout_hicc1=85&lt;region&gt;sample=e4_mf. wav xfin_locc1=43 xfin_hicc1=85 xfout_locc1=86 xfout_hicc1=127&lt;region&gt;sample=e4_f. wav xfin_locc1=86 xfin_hicc1=127&lt;group&gt;lokey=50 hikey=51 pitch_keycenter=50 sw_last=49&lt;region&gt;sample=d4_ft_p. wav xfin_locc1=0 xfin_hicc1=63 xfout_locc1=64 xfout_hicc1=127&lt;region&gt;sample=d4_ft_f. wav xfin_locc1=64 xfin_hicc1=127&lt;group&gt;lokey=52 hikey=53 pitch_keycenter=52 sw_last=49&lt;region&gt;sample=e4_ft_p. wav xfin_locc1=0 xfin_hicc1=63 xfout_locc1=64 xfout_hicc1=127&lt;region&gt;sample=e4_ft_f. wav xfin_locc1=64 xfin_hicc1=127This is enough to make a basic monophonic wind instrument, vocal, or othermonophonic instrument. There are more possibilities - better legato, vibratoemulation, multiple microphone positions etc. - which we’ll describe later inanother part of this guide. Together with the information covered in drum basicsearlier, this should also be enough to make a basic sampled piano or guitar.

    "body": "Values can be:  attack : (Default): Region will play on note-on.  release: Region will play on note-off or sustain pedal off. The velocity       used to play the note-off sample is the velocity value of the       corresponding (previous) note-on message.  first: Region will play on note-on, but if there’s no other note going on      (commonly used for or first note in a legato phrase).  legato: Region will play on note-on, but only if there’s a note going on      (notes after first note in a legato phrase).  release_key: Region will play on note-off. Ignores sustain pedal. Practical Considerations: This entire section is dedicated to release triggers, which can get quite complex. Setting trigger to release or release_key will cause the region to play as ifloop_mode was set to one_shot. Beyond that, release region behavior varies considerably between SFZ players. rcg sfz:  Both release or release_key regions play whether there is a previous attack region or not.  Release_key regions won’t play when releasing the sustain pedal. Release samples only playwhen sustain pedal is up (not depressed).  In sfz v1, there is no polyphony or note_polyphony for limiting the number of simultaneousrelease regions playing, which can result in a very large number of release regions triggeredwhen the sustain pedal is raised. DropZone and other Cakewalk players:  Both release or release_key require a previous attack region.  Release_key regions won’t play when releasing the sustain pedal. Release samples only playwhen sustain pedal is up (not depressed).  To make release or release_key plays without any previous attack region, setrt_dead to on.  note_polyphony is now available to control the accumulation ofrelease voices of repeated notes when Sustain pedal is down. ARIA and Sforzando:  release requires a previous attack region.  release_key doesn’t require a previous attack region.  release responds to Sustain Pedal position.  release_key ignores Sustain Pedal completely.  rt_dead is not supported, and defaults to off.  note_polyphony is available to control the accumulation of release voices. Release samples can require a corresponding region with trigger set to attack to be active atthe moment when the note-off message is received, or the release region will never play. In rgc sfz, this is not required. In DropZone and other Cakewalk players, it is requiredunless rt_dead is set to on. In ARIA, it is required for trigger=releaseregions but not for trigger=release_key regions. For cases where a corresponding attack region is required, here is more detail. An attack region is considered corresponding if it has the same MIDI note number,and the same velocity range, as the release region. The velocity which matters here isthe note-on velocity of the initial region - not the velocity of the note-off messagewhich triggers the release region. Round robins do not need to match, so it is possibleto for example have five round robins for releases and only four round robins forattacks. This corresponding attack region is then used to calculate the volume of the releaseregion based on the attack region’s velocity and rt_decay. If there isno corresponding attack region, or the corresponding attack region has finished playing dueto reaching sample end etc, then the release region will not play. This is designed primarilydesigned for piano release samples. Triggering a release sample without a corresponding attack region is is useful for releasesamples which are noises not dependent on the volume of any corresponding note, suchas hurdy-gurdy key returns, which will sound the same whether the wheel is turningor not. Note that at least in ARIA and Sforzando, a note-on event which triggers multiple regions(for example a multimic instrument, or one with simulated unison) will have multiplecorresponding regions for the release region, causing the release region to be triggeredmultiple times. With seven mics and a separate release for each mic, this would mean akey release would trigger a total of 49 samples if not controlled with note_polyphony. However, setting note_polyphony=1 and giving each mic a different [group] number solves this. When using releases with round robins and multiple voices, it can be tricky to makethe release sample round robin counter advance correctly. When there are 2 matchingregions playing, ARIA appears to advance the counter for the releases by 2, and ifthere are 4 release round robins, only 2 of them will actually be used. One workaroundfor that is triggering an extra region of silence to make the round robin counteradvance by 3, but this will only work if the number of regions is consistent andpredictable. With instruments that have release samples with a number of microphonepositions or organ stops, any of which could be on or off, the total number of matchingregions is very difficult to assess, and it’s far easier to use lorand/hirand toselect the release samples instead. on_loccN / on_hiccN effectively replace the default trigger=attack,as it is used for regions which are to be triggered by MIDI CC messages and not MIDInote messages. For regions which use these opcodes, trigger should be left unspecified. Examples: trigger=releasetrigger=legato"

    "body": "This tutorial describes various methods of using one set of samples to emulatethe sound of larger numbers of instruments - making a small ensemble soundlarger, using one set of samples for both first and second violins, automaticallymultitracking guitars, synthesizer oscillator unison etc. Transposition: Let’s say we have only one sampled violin section, and need to use both first andsecond violins. Using just one octave of range for simplicity, this is our firstviolins example: &lt;global&gt;&lt;region&gt;sample=c4. wav key=48&lt;region&gt;sample=db4. wav key=49&lt;region&gt;sample=d4. wav key=50&lt;region&gt;sample=eb4. wav key=51&lt;region&gt;sample=e4. wav key=52&lt;region&gt;sample=f4. wav key=53&lt;region&gt;sample=gb4. wav key=54&lt;region&gt;sample=g4. wav key=55&lt;region&gt;sample=ab4. wav key=56&lt;region&gt;sample=a4. wav key=57&lt;region&gt;sample=bb4. wav key=58&lt;region&gt;sample=b4. wav key=59&lt;region&gt;sample=c5. wav key=60Using this for both first and second violins will result in two identical-soundingsections with the same timbre, but it’s easily possible to use the same samplestransposed, and get a different timbre. Instead of using the C4 sample to play C4,use the Db4 sample transposed down a half step to play C4. This can be done byusing lokey, hikey and pitch_keycenter opcodes instead of just key. &lt;region&gt;sample=c4. wav lokey=47 hikey=47 pitch_keycenter=48&lt;region&gt;sample=db4. wav lokey=48 hikey=48 pitch_keycenter=49&lt;region&gt;sample=d4. wav lokey=49 hikey=49 pitch_keycenter=50&lt;region&gt;sample=eb4. wav lokey=50 hikey=50 pitch_keycenter=51&lt;region&gt;sample=e4. wav lokey=51 hikey=51 pitch_keycenter=52&lt;region&gt;sample=f4. wav lokey=52 hikey=52 pitch_keycenter=53&lt;region&gt;sample=gb4. wav lokey=53 hikey=53 pitch_keycenter=54&lt;region&gt;sample=g4. wav lokey=54 hikey=54 pitch_keycenter=55&lt;region&gt;sample=ab4. wav lokey=55 hikey=55 pitch_keycenter=56&lt;region&gt;sample=a4. wav lokey=56 hikey=56 pitch_keycenter=57&lt;region&gt;sample=bb4. wav lokey=57 hikey=57 pitch_keycenter=58&lt;region&gt;sample=b4. wav lokey=58 hikey=58 pitch_keycenter=59&lt;region&gt;sample=c5. wav lokey=59 hikey=59 pitch_keycenter=60Howerver, in most cases it’s easier to use the key and transpose opcodes instead,and set the transpose amount for all the transposed regions at once. &lt;global&gt;transpose=-1&lt;region&gt;sample=c4. wav key=47&lt;region&gt;sample=db4. wav key=48&lt;region&gt;sample=d4. wav key=49&lt;region&gt;sample=eb4. wav key=50&lt;region&gt;sample=e4. wav key=51&lt;region&gt;sample=f4. wav key=52&lt;region&gt;sample=gb4. wav key=53&lt;region&gt;sample=g4. wav key=54&lt;region&gt;sample=ab4. wav key=55&lt;region&gt;sample=a4. wav key=56&lt;region&gt;sample=bb4. wav key=57&lt;region&gt;sample=b4. wav key=58&lt;region&gt;sample=c5. wav key=59This still requires changing the key opcode for every region, however. Doingthis editing manually on large sample sets would be time-consuming, butthe old tool sfzed allows easily adding, subtracting or multiplying currentparameter values to regions, which becomes very useful when doing this withthousands of samples. This shifts the entire range of the instrument down by a half-step, though. Inorder to preserve the correct range, we can remove the transposed notes whichgot moved below the lowest pitch the instrument is capable of. That’s easy. Thetop range is more tricky - if we extend the highest note to cover its originalpitch as well, but then the same sample would be used for the same pitch byboth sections. So, we can instead use the next-to-highest note, transposed up. This might not sound very consistent with the rest, but under these limitations,it can be a reasonable compromise. &lt;global&gt;transpose=-1&lt;region&gt;sample=db4. wav key=48&lt;region&gt;sample=d4. wav key=49&lt;region&gt;sample=eb4. wav key=50&lt;region&gt;sample=e4. wav key=51&lt;region&gt;sample=f4. wav key=52&lt;region&gt;sample=gb4. wav key=53&lt;region&gt;sample=g4. wav key=54&lt;region&gt;sample=ab4. wav key=55&lt;region&gt;sample=a4. wav key=56&lt;region&gt;sample=bb4. wav key=57&lt;region&gt;sample=b4. wav key=58&lt;region&gt;sample=c5. wav key=59&lt;region&gt;sample=b4. wav key=60 transpose=1Transposition Values: In general, transposing downwards will result in a warmer sound, and transposingupwards will make the sound brighter and thinner. Transposing by more than a halfstep can be a good idea. In general, transposing by a minor third is a common wayto create a big change in timbre. Transposing by much more than a minor thirddoesn’t seem common outside of sound design not intended to be a realistic instrumentemulation. Transposing down by a minor third while preserving the range in our example, andfilling in the lost top of the range by transposing upwards might look like this: &lt;global&gt;transpose=-3&lt;region&gt;sample=eb4. wav key=48&lt;region&gt;sample=e4. wav key=49&lt;region&gt;sample=f4. wav key=50&lt;region&gt;sample=gb4. wav key=51&lt;region&gt;sample=g4. wav key=52&lt;region&gt;sample=ab4. wav key=53&lt;region&gt;sample=a4. wav key=54&lt;region&gt;sample=bb4. wav key=55&lt;region&gt;sample=b4. wav key=56&lt;region&gt;sample=c5. wav key=57&lt;region&gt;sample=a4. wav key=58 transpose=1&lt;region&gt;sample=bb4. wav key=59 transpose=1&lt;region&gt;sample=b4. wav key=60 transpose=1Note that all of the above assumes the instrument is sampled chromatically; forinstruments which are sampled at wholetone intervals or diatonically, transpositionby at least a whole step will be necessary to avoid using the same samples for anote. Instruments which are sampled every minor third will need an interval of atleast a minor third etc. Unison By Transposition: If we put both the original and transposed samples in the same SFZ file, each MIDInote will trigger two regions, and we now will have the sound of an ensemble whichis twice as large as what was actually sampled. &lt;group&gt;&lt;region&gt;sample=c4. wav key=48&lt;region&gt;sample=db4. wav key=49&lt;region&gt;sample=d4. wav key=50&lt;region&gt;sample=eb4. wav key=51&lt;region&gt;sample=e4. wav key=52&lt;region&gt;sample=f4. wav key=53&lt;region&gt;sample=gb4. wav key=54&lt;region&gt;sample=g4. wav key=55&lt;region&gt;sample=ab4. wav key=56&lt;region&gt;sample=a4. wav key=57&lt;region&gt;sample=bb4. wav key=58&lt;region&gt;sample=b4. wav key=59&lt;region&gt;sample=c5. wav key=60&lt;group&gt;transpose=-1&lt;region&gt;sample=db4. wav key=48&lt;region&gt;sample=d4. wav key=49&lt;region&gt;sample=eb4. wav key=50&lt;region&gt;sample=e4. wav key=51&lt;region&gt;sample=f4. wav key=52&lt;region&gt;sample=gb4. wav key=53&lt;region&gt;sample=g4. wav key=54&lt;region&gt;sample=ab4. wav key=55&lt;region&gt;sample=a4. wav key=56&lt;region&gt;sample=bb4. wav key=57&lt;region&gt;sample=b4. wav key=58&lt;region&gt;sample=c5. wav key=59&lt;region&gt;sample=b4. wav key=60 transpose=1Unison By Round Robin: For cases where the goal is to emulate overdubbed copies of the same instrumentwith the same timbre, rather than different instruments with different timbres,it’s still necessary to avoid triggering the same samples. For example,is how guitar multitracking is typically emulated. This approach alsoworks for instruments which are not pitched but it makes sense to layer them,for example handclaps. In such cases, unison can be implemented by usingdifferent round robin samples for each simultaneously playing sample. Usingone note with four round robins as an example: &lt;group&gt;seq_length=4 key=48&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr1. wav seq_position=1&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr2. wav seq_position=2&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr3. wav seq_position=3&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr4. wav seq_position=4We can create two by offsetting the round robins like this: &lt;group&gt;seq_length=4 key=48&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr1. wav seq_position=1&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr2. wav seq_position=2&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr3. wav seq_position=3&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr4. wav seq_position=4&lt;group&gt;seq_length=4 key=48&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr1. wav seq_position=4&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr2. wav seq_position=1&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr3. wav seq_position=2&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr4. wav seq_position=3The group headers aren’t necessary and everything could be under one group,but for organizational purposes, they can make things easier. Or three, or a maximum of four: &lt;group&gt;seq_length=4 key=48&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr1. wav seq_position=1&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr2. wav seq_position=2&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr3. wav seq_position=3&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr4. wav seq_position=4&lt;group&gt;seq_length=4 key=48&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr1. wav seq_position=4&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr2. wav seq_position=1&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr3. wav seq_position=2&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr4. wav seq_position=3&lt;group&gt;seq_length=4 key=48&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr1. wav seq_position=3&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr2. wav seq_position=4&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr3. wav seq_position=1&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr4. wav seq_position=2&lt;group&gt;seq_length=4 key=48&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr1. wav seq_position=2&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr2. wav seq_position=3&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr3. wav seq_position=4&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr4. wav seq_position=1Note that this will not work well with random round robins, as it’spossible that the same sample will be randomly selected for multipleregions. Width And Detune: Multitracked guitars will often be spread in stereo, as will unison voicesin synthesizers etc. Spreading the above quad-tracked guitar in stereois simple: &lt;group&gt;seq_length=4 key=48pan=-100&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr1. wav seq_position=1&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr2. wav seq_position=2&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr3. wav seq_position=3&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr4. wav seq_position=4&lt;group&gt;seq_length=4 key=48pan=100&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr1. wav seq_position=4&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr2. wav seq_position=1&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr3. wav seq_position=2&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr4. wav seq_position=3&lt;group&gt;seq_length=4 key=48pan=-50&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr1. wav seq_position=3&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr2. wav seq_position=4&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr3. wav seq_position=1&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr4. wav seq_position=2&lt;group&gt;seq_length=4 key=48pan=50&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr1. wav seq_position=2&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr2. wav seq_position=3&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr3. wav seq_position=4&lt;region&gt;sample=c4_rr4. wav seq_position=1It’s also possible to apply slight detuning to each voice. That’s probablynot common with guitars, and unnecessary with section recordings where naturaltuning differences will already be captured in the recordings, but it is verycommon in synthesizers, and can also be helpful when trying to turn soloinstrument samples into a small section. Detune can even be used by itselfto create multiple voices, and this is an especially viable approach forsynthesizers. The amount of detune, as well as width, can be modulated. Hereis an example of a saw oscillator with seven voices. &lt;region&gt;sample=*saw&lt;region&gt;pitch_oncc100=20 pan_oncc101=100 sample=*saw&lt;region&gt;pitch_oncc100=-20 pan_oncc101=-100 sample=*saw&lt;region&gt;pitch_oncc100=30 pan_oncc101=67 sample=*saw&lt;region&gt;pitch_oncc100=-30 pan_oncc101=-67 sample=*saw&lt;region&gt;pitch_oncc100=40 pan_oncc101=33 sample=*saw&lt;region&gt;pitch_oncc100=-40 pan_oncc101=-33 sample=*sawLegato: When self-muting is implemented, each set of unison samples will need to have itsown polyphony groups, same as would be needed with multiple microphone positions. If there are true legato samples, that adds considerable complexity to thetransposition trick. The below steps are not a universal set of instructions, buthave worked successfully for at least one instrument.  Create an extended-range map extending the range by the largest transposition amount in the direction opposite of the transposition. For example, if there are four transposed voices and are to be transposed down by a half-step, a full step, a minor third and a major third, add a major third of range to the top of the extended map. See the range extension tutorial for details.  Make copies of this extended map to create the to-be-transposed maps.  In each map, add the aomount of shift for the particular map (for example -1) to lokey, hikey and sw_previous.  Delete any regions with lokey or hikey above or below the final desired range, which might be both at the top and bottom of a map.  Delete any regions with sw_previous above or below the final desired range. This isn’t strictly necessary as those regions “should” never be played, but will reduce parsing time and prevent weirdness when a note slightly outside the range is held by mistake and a note inside the range is pressed. Humanization: When trying to emulate the sound of a larger section of instruments, especially whentrying to turn a solo instrument into an emulated section, it can be useful tocreate small differences between each voice, especially when vibrato and legatoare also emulated. This is probably not that important with sampled ensembles, suchas emulating second violins, but with solo instruments it becomes crucial. Withoutindependent per-voice humanization, emulated vibrato and legato can sound more likea solo instrument run through a chorus or other doubling effect, rather than separateperformances. Aspects of the sound which can be humanized or randomized include timing, smoothing,phase, pitch, vibrato speed and vibrato depth. Here is a rather lengthy example, adapted from a real instrument, where each voice hasseparate pan settings for stereo spread and separate polyphony groups - these are basicfeatures of unison, and not related to humanization, of course. The humanizingdifferences between the voices are differences in bend smoothing, in maximum vibratodepth, in the initial phase of the vibrato humanization LFOs, and in the fade times ofthe legato regions. The shallower vibrato and slower legato of the transposed regionsemulate less confident, more hesitant players. &lt;global&gt;//Basic global stuff shared by all voicesampeg_release=0. 25ampeg_attack_oncc106=1ampeg_release_oncc107=1. 25off_mode=normalbend_down=-1200bend_up=1200//Pitch bend smoothing is set separately for each voiceamplitude_oncc100=100amplitude_smoothcc1=100locc100=1amp_veltrack=0loop_mode=loop_continuous//Vibrato//Pitch LFO depth is set separately for each voicelfo01_freq=2 //Any slower than this sounds really lousylfo01_freq_oncc112=6 //8 Hz is about as fast as vibrato on cello can golfo01_delay_oncc115=0. 500lfo01_fade_oncc116=0. 500//This LFO also does tremololfo01_volume_oncc21=1 //Not much - just a subtle effect on volumeeq1_freq=2200 //EQ band for vibratoeq1_bw=2lfo01_eq1gain_oncc21=3 //Again, pretty subtlelfo02_wave=1 //Second LFO to make things wobblier//Initial phase is set separately for each voicelfo02_phase_oncc131=0. 7 //Phase affected by velocity, to pseudo-randomize while keeping both mics' LFOs in synclfo02_freq=0. 01 //Basically no movement at very slow speeds, just randomizationlfo02_freq_oncc117=1 //Max rate is not very high, so it doesn't sound too obviouslfo02_pitch_oncc117=6 //Slight pitch wobblinesslfo02_freq_lfo01_oncc117=0. 2 lfo02_freq_lfo01_oncc112=0. 8 //Affect the rate of the other LFO for unsteady vibratolfo03_wave=1 //And a third LFO for secondhand complex wobbliness//Initial phase is set separately for each voicelfo03_phase_oncc131=0. 479 //Different phase response to velocity than the second LFOlfo03_freq=0. 5lfo03_freq_oncc117=-0. 4lfo03_freq_lfo2_oncc117=1lfo03_pitch_oncc117=-4&lt;master&gt;//Central voicebend_smooth=80lfo01_pitch_oncc21=29lfo02_phase=0lfo03_phase=0. 4group=1off_by=1//Sustains legato&lt;group&gt;trigger=first#include  mappings/ord_sus_map. sfz &lt;group&gt;trigger=legatooffset=5000 offset_random=500ampeg_attack=0. 5ampeg_vel2attack=-0. 35#include  mappings/ord_sus_map. sfz &lt;master&gt;//Left voice using sample maps transposed by a half-step//Pan control not used in the central voicepan_oncc101=-100//Values different than the central voice, for humanization purposesbend_smooth=91lfo01_pitch_oncc21=17lfo02_phase=0. 05lfo03_phase=0. 3group=2off_by=2//Sustains legato&lt;group&gt;trigger=first#include  mappings/t1/ord_sus_map. sfz &lt;group&gt;trigger=legatooffset=5000 offset_random=500//Values different than the central voice, for humanization purposesampeg_attack=0. 55ampeg_vel2attack=-0. 4#include  mappings/t1/ord_sus_map. sfz &lt;master&gt;//Right voice using sample maps transposed by a whole step//Pan control not used in the central voicepan_oncc101=100//Values different than the central voice, for humanization purposesbend_smooth=87lfo01_pitch_oncc21=19lfo02_phase=0. 02lfo03_phase=0. 28group=3off_by=3//Sustains legato&lt;master&gt;trigger=first#include  mappings/t2/ord_sus_map. sfz &lt;master&gt;trigger=legatooffset=5000 offset_random=500//Values different than the central voice, for humanization purposesampeg_attack=0. 58ampeg_vel2attack=-0. 43#include  mappings/t2/ord_sus_map. sfz Releases: Implementing release samples with unison requires a little extra effort. It’s easiestto simply implement releases for the center voice only, but even then it’s necessaryto be careful to avoid triggering too many release samples. At least in ARIA and Sforzando, a note-on event which triggers multiple regions(for example a multimic instrument, or one with simulated unison) will have multiplecorresponding regions for the release region, causing the release region to be triggeredmultiple times. With seven mics and a separate release for each mic, this would mean akey release would trigger a total of 49 samples if not controlled with note_polyphony. However, setting note_polyphony=1 and giving each mic a different group number solves this. There’s no need tu use off_by with the release groups. An example with releases only for the center voice: &lt;global&gt;//Basic global stuff shared by all voicesampeg_release=0. 25off_mode=normal//Center voice&lt;master&gt;//Sustains&lt;group&gt;#include  mappings/ord_sus_map. sfz //Releases&lt;group&gt;trigger=releasegroup=501note_polyphony=1#include  mappings/ord_rel_map. sfz &lt;master&gt;//Left voice using sample maps transposed by a half-step//Pan control not used in the central voicepan_oncc101=-100//Sustains&lt;group&gt;#include  mappings/t1/ord_sus_map. sfz &lt;master&gt;//Right voice using sample maps transposed by a whole step//Pan control not used in the central voicepan_oncc101=100//Sustains&lt;master&gt;#include  mappings/t2/ord_sus_map. sfz With releases for all voices, just use a different group number for each voice’sreleases, like this example: &lt;global&gt;//Basic global stuff shared by all voicesampeg_release=0. 25off_mode=normal//Center voice&lt;master&gt;//Sustains&lt;group&gt;#include  mappings/ord_sus_map. sfz //Releases&lt;group&gt;trigger=releasegroup=501note_polyphony=1#include  mappings/ord_rel_map. sfz &lt;master&gt;//Left voice using sample maps transposed by a half-step//Pan control not used in the central voicepan_oncc101=-100//Sustains&lt;group&gt;#include  mappings/t1/ord_sus_map. sfz //Releases&lt;group&gt;trigger=releasegroup=502note_polyphony=1#include  mappings/t1/ord_rel_map. sfz &lt;master&gt;//Right voice using sample maps transposed by a whole step//Pan control not used in the central voicepan_oncc101=100//Sustains&lt;master&gt;#include  mappings/t2/ord_sus_map. sfz //Releases&lt;group&gt;trigger=releasegroup=503note_polyphony=1#include  mappings/t2/ord_rel_map. sfz When using releases with round robins, it can be tricky to make the release sampleround robin counter advance correctly. When there are 2 “matching” samples playing,ARIA appears to advance the counter for the releases by 2, and if there are 4release round robins, only 2 of them will actually be used. One workaround for thatis triggering an extra region of silence to make the round robin counter advance by3, but this will only work if the number of regions is consistent and predictable. With instruments that have release samples with a number of microphone positionsor organ stops, any of which could be on or off, the total number of matchingregions is very difficult to assess, and it’s far easier to use lorand/hirand toselect the release samples instead. Round Robin Neighbor Borrowing: Although not a method of achieving unison, round robin neighbor borrowingis another use of transposition, which likewise milks more out of a limitedset of samples - specifically, emulating round robins where there are none,or increasing the amonut of available round robins. This works with either sequential round robin and random round robinapproaches, or both at once. Let’s use sequential round robins for thisexample, with a very small note range and three round robins sampled. &lt;global&gt;seq_length=3&lt;group&gt;seq_position=1&lt;region&gt;sample=c5_rr1. wav key=60&lt;region&gt;sample=c#5_rr1. wav key=61&lt;region&gt;sample=d5_rr1. wav key=62&lt;group&gt;seq_position=2&lt;region&gt;sample=c5_rr2. wav key=60&lt;region&gt;sample=c#5_rr2. wav key=61&lt;region&gt;sample=d5_rr2. wav key=62&lt;group&gt;seq_position=3&lt;region&gt;sample=c5_rr3. wav key=60&lt;region&gt;sample=c#5_rr3. wav key=61&lt;region&gt;sample=d5_rr3. wav key=62We can double the amount of round robins by using a transposedsample from a neighboring note for every other note in thesequence. This means every other note repeat has a slightlydifferent timbre, but it should sound more acceptable thanusing untransposed notes for the first three sequence positionsand transposed notes for positions four through six. So, weincrease the sequence length to six, and alternate betweentransposed and untransposed samples like this: &lt;global&gt;seq_length=6&lt;group&gt;seq_position=1&lt;region&gt;sample=c5_rr1. wav key=60&lt;region&gt;sample=c#5_rr1. wav key=61&lt;region&gt;sample=d5_rr1. wav key=62&lt;group&gt;seq_position=2&lt;region&gt;sample=c#5_rr1. wav key=60 transpose=-1&lt;region&gt;sample=d5_rr1. wav key=61 transpose=-1&lt;region&gt;sample=c#5_rr1. wav key=62 transpose=1&lt;group&gt;seq_position=3&lt;region&gt;sample=c5_rr2. wav key=60&lt;region&gt;sample=c#5_rr2. wav key=61&lt;region&gt;sample=d5_rr2. wav key=62&lt;group&gt;seq_position=4&lt;region&gt;sample=c#5_rr2. wav key=60 transpose=-1&lt;region&gt;sample=d5_rr2. wav key=61 transpose=-1&lt;region&gt;sample=c#5_rr2. wav key=62 transpose=1&lt;group&gt;seq_position=5&lt;region&gt;sample=c5_rr3. wav key=60&lt;region&gt;sample=c#5_rr3. wav key=61&lt;region&gt;sample=d5_rr3. wav key=62&lt;group&gt;seq_position=6&lt;region&gt;sample=c#5_rr3. wav key=60 transpose=-1&lt;region&gt;sample=d5_rr3. wav key=61 transpose=-1&lt;region&gt;sample=c#5_rr3. wav key=62 transpose=1It’s also possible to triple the amount of round robins byborrowing neighbors in both upwards and downwards directionfor each note (except the lowest and highest note in the range,of course). In general, transposing by more than a half-stepis not a good idea, as the timbral differences grow larger withlarger transposition, but with some instruments it can bepossible to get away with it. If there are many dynamic layersavailable, it’s also possible to borrow from nearby dynamic layers,especially in the case of drums. "

A lot of this can be done under the SFZ 1 specification as well, butthere are some limitations. The most basic, typical vibrato is pitch vibrato - just an LFO modulating pitch. Making theminimum and maximum rates and depths that would be used by players in real life is important,of course. The numbers here are examples which would be decent for bowed strings - it has arate of 2-10 Hz and a maximum depth of 35 cents. Wider and slower are certainly possibleon real instruments, but isn’t commonly used in performance. lfo01_pitch_oncc111=35lfo01_freq=2lfo01_freq_oncc112=8Additional parameters: In real life, however, players and singers will often start a note without vibrato,and add vibrato a fraction of a second later. This is where modulating the [LFO delay parameter][2] becomes useful, and possibly [LFO fade][3] as well. Delay seems like enough for most windinstruments and vocals, but having both delay and fade seems effective with bowed strings. lfo01_pitch_oncc111=35lfo01_freq=2lfo01_freq_oncc112=8lfo01_delay_oncc115=0. 500lfo01_fade_oncc116=0. 500Vibrato on many instruments doesn’t just affect pitch; on bowed strings, it seems to havea subtle effect on volume and timbre as well. We can have the same MIDI CC parameter controlhow much the vibrato LFO affects pitch, volume, and an EQ band, with the latter two beingquite subtle. This is a good a time as any to note that not all vibrato is equal - it’s not reallypractical to add vibrato to the lowest note playable on a cello, for example, or to anatural harmonic. With pizzicato, vibrato is possible, but probably should not affect theEQ band, and either only affect pitch or pitch plus a subtle effect on volume. The belowwill work reasonably for most bowed notes, however. lfo01_pitch_oncc111=35lfo01_volume_oncc111=1lfo01_freq=2lfo01_freq_oncc112=8lfo01_delay_oncc115=0. 500lfo01_fade_oncc116=0. 500eq1_freq=2000eq1_bw=2lfo01_eq1gain_oncc111=2lfo01_eq1freq_oncc111=500Humanization: Vibrato can also be humanized, by varying the rate of the vibrato LFO. This can be doneby modulating the rate of the vibrato LFO with another LFO. The ARIA sample &amp; hold[waveform][4] can be used here, and the modulation depth controlled by MIDI CC, so when that’sat zero, no humanization happens. lfo02_freq=1lfo02_wave=12 //Sample &amp; hold LFO waveform numberlfo02_freq_lfo01_oncc117=1Or, to stay in the SFZ 2 spec and not use ARIA extensions, a sine wave with randomized[starting phase][5] will also work: lfo02_freq=1lfo02_phase_oncc135=1lfo02_freq_lfo01_oncc117=1However, when playing multiple layers, such as sustain samples with crossfaded dynamicsor multiple mic positions, this can cause each layer’s vibrato to drift out of sync andsound like separate instruments. This is generally not desirable, so it is possible topseudo-randomize the starting phase using a non-random [CC, such as velocity][6](which is often otherwise unused in sustain sounds with crossfaded dynamics). If the SFZplayer can have a global sample and hold LFO which does not retrigger for each note, thiswould also be a solution, though ARIA does not allow this. lfo02_freq=1lfo02_phase_oncc132=0. 7lfo02_freq_lfo01_oncc117=1This will vary the rate of the vibrato, but the depth will be constant. It is possible to havean LFO modulate the depth of another LFO, measured as a percentage, for example 120% for 20% variation: lfo02_freq=1lfo02_phase_oncc132=0. 7lfo02_freq_lfo01_oncc117=1lfo02_depth_lfo01=120For additional complexity, it’s also possible to have the random LFO itself modulate pitch,which will create some pitch drift, and have more than two LFOs involved. Here is a fairlysophisticated example. //Vibratolfo01_pitch_oncc21=29 //Vibrato LFOlfo01_freq=2 //Any slower than this sounds really lousylfo01_freq_oncc112=6 //8 Hz is about as fast as vibrato on cello can golfo01_delay_oncc115=0. 500lfo01_fade_oncc116=0. 500//This LFO also does tremololfo01_volume_oncc21=1 //Not much - just a subtle effect on volumeeq1_freq=2200 //EQ band for vibratoeq1_bw=2lfo01_eq1gain_oncc21=3 //Again, pretty subtlelfo02_wave=1 //Second LFO to make things wobblierlfo02_phase=0lfo02_phase_oncc131=0. 7 //Phase affected by velocity, to pseudo-randomize while keeping both mics' LFOs in synclfo02_freq=0. 01 //Basically no movement at very slow speeds, just randomizationlfo02_freq_oncc117=1 //Max rate is not very high, so it doesn't sound too obviouslfo02_pitch_oncc117=6 //Slight pitch wobblinesslfo02_freq_lfo01_oncc117=1 //Affect the rate of the other LFO for unsteady vibratolfo03_wave=1 //And a third LFO for secondhand complex wobblinesslfo03_phase=0. 4lfo03_phase_oncc131=0. 479 //Different phase response to velocity than the second LFOlfo03_freq=0. 5lfo03_freq_oncc117=-0. 4lfo03_freq_lfo02_oncc117=1lfo03_pitch_oncc117=-4However, note that the depth modulation is fixed, and not modulated by cc117 like the frequency modulationis. This is because having a CC modulate the depth modulation does not appear to be implemented in ARIA. It is, however, possible to modulate the depth of a flex envelope with MIDI CC, and then have that envelopedepth modulate the depth of the secondary LFO. This is, admittedly, very much a kludge, but it appears towork. lfo02_freq=1lfo02_phase_oncc132=0. 7lfo02_freq_lfo01_oncc117=1lfo02_depth_lfo01=120eg1_level0_oncc117=1eg1_level1_oncc117=1eg1_depth_lfo02=100However, when the depth of lfo02 is zero, this will effectively also make lfo01’s depth zero, so therewill be no vibrato at all unless cc117 is turned up. Getting around this requires another kludge, whichis leaving lfo01 with fixed depth and creating yet another LFO for the variable part of the depth. //Vibratolfo01_pitch_oncc21=29 //Vibrato LFOlfo01_freq=2 //Any slower than this sounds really lousylfo01_freq_oncc112=6 //8 Hz is about as fast as vibrato on cello can golfo01_delay_oncc115=0. 500lfo01_fade_oncc116=0. 500//This LFO also does tremololfo01_volume_oncc21=1 //Not much - just a subtle effect on volumeeq1_freq=2200 //EQ band for vibratoeq1_bw=2lfo01_eq1gain_oncc21=3 //Again, pretty subtlelfo02_pitch_oncc21=19 //Extra LFO for variable depth, shallower than main and pitch onlylfo02_freq=2 //Same timing as first LFOlfo02_freq_oncc112=6lfo02_delay_oncc115=0. 500lfo02_fade_oncc116=0. 500lfo03_wave=1 //Third LFO to make the flrst two LFOs wobblierlfo03_phase=0lfo03_phase_oncc131=0. 7 //Phase affected by velocity, to pseudo-randomize while keeping both mics' LFOs in synclfo03_freq=0. 01 //Basically no movement at very slow speeds, just randomizationlfo03_freq_oncc117=1 //Max rate is not very high, so it doesn't sound too obviouslfo03_pitch=6 //Slight pitch wobblinesslfo03_freq_lfo01=1lfo03_freq_lfo02=1 //Affect the rate of the vibrato LFOs for unsteady vibratolfo04_wave=1 //And a fourth LFO for secondhand complex wobblinesslfo04_phase=0. 4lfo04_phase_oncc131=0. 479 //Different phase response to velocity than the second LFOlfo04_freq=0. 5lfo04_freq_oncc117=-0. 4lfo04_freq_lfo03=1lfo04_pitch=-4lfo03_depth_lfo02=100lfo04_depth_lfo02=100eg1_level0_oncc117=1eg1_level1_oncc117=1eg1_depth_lfo03=100eg1_depth_lfo04=100Asymmetrical vibrato: Something similar to the above will work fairly well for a range of strings and voices. However, there are cases where vibrato should only go in one direction - for example,bending guitar strings only moves the pitch upwards, while on saxophone it’s possibleto play vibrato centered around the pitch, but most of the time players will go onlybelow the pitch. Let’s use saxophone vibrato as an example. To keep it simple, let’sjust go back to a simple, non-humanized vibrato with only depth and rate paremeters. To have vibrato which will go below the main pitch is simple - the LFO phase can beset so the wave starts at the top, and the note [tuned][7] down by the vibrato depth amount. lfo01_pitch_oncc111=20lfo01_phase=0. 25lfo01_freq=1. 5lfo01_freq_oncc112=6pitch_oncc111=-20This will work fine, as long as we don’t try to apply delay or fade to the LFO, whichwould result in the note starting out flat with no vibrato. To solve that problem, wecan combine the LFO with a pitch [envelope][8]. Here is an example with just delay: lfo01_pitch_oncc111=20lfo01_freq=1. 5lfo01_freq_oncc112=6lfo01_phase=0. 25lfo01_delay_oncc116=1pitcheg_delay_oncc116=1pitcheg_depth_oncc111=-20To have the choice of idiomatic sax vibrato and violin-style vibrato centered around the pitchcan be done separate LFOs and separate depth controls. It’s also possible to duplicate all theregions and use [loccN/hiccN][9] to select between ones with different styles of vibrato. lfo01_pitch_oncc111=20 //Sax vibrato LFO - goes down from the main pitchlfo01_freq=1. 5lfo01_freq_oncc112=6lfo01_phase=0. 25 //Starts at toplfo01_delay_oncc116=1pitcheg_delay_oncc116=1 //Pitch envelope to drop the central pitch when sax vibrato kicks inpitcheg_depth_oncc111=-20lfo02_pitch_oncc114=20 //Violin vibrato LFO - goes below and above main pitchlfo02_freq=1. 5lfo02_freq_oncc112=6 //Same rate as the first LFOlfo02_phase=0. 5 //Starts in the middle, goes down first before going uplfo02_delay_oncc116=1 //Same delay, tooThis covers jaw vibrato, but sax players also use diaphragm vibrato, which changes volumeand has no effect on pitch, which means there are now three vibrato depths. Having thevolume modulated by the second LFO is a little easier, as the phase setting of the firstLFO would mean having to apply a volume envelope as well. lfo01_pitch_oncc111=20 //Sax vibrato LFO - goes down from the main pitchlfo01_freq=1. 5lfo01_freq_oncc112=6lfo01_phase=0. 25 //Starts at toplfo01_delay_oncc116=1pitcheg_delay_oncc116=1 //Pitch envelope to drop the central pitch when sax vibrato kicks inpitcheg_depth_oncc111=-20lfo02_pitch_oncc114=20 //Violin vibrato LFO - goes below and above main pitchlfo02_freq=1. 5lfo02_freq_oncc112=6 //Same rate as the first LFOlfo02_delay_oncc116=1 //Same delay, toolfo02_phase=0. 5 //Starts in the middle, goes down first before going uplfo02_volume=0 //This LFO also does tremololfo02_volume_oncc113=3There is one additional consideration with diaphragm vibrato - whenthe volume of the note drops down, the breath noise can become more prominent, especially onquiet notes or when using the subtone technique. If the volume of the breath noise can bemodulated separately, the noise regions should not be affected by pitch vibrato, and beaffected by the diaphragm vibrato in an opposite direction to the notes. So, if the abovevibrato settings are set under a [‹global›] header, the breath noisesample regions could have settings similar to this. lfo01_pitch_oncc111=0 //LFOs do not affect pitchpitcheg_depth_oncc111=0lfo02_pitch_oncc114=0lfo02_volume_oncc113=-3 //Diaphragm vibrato affects volume in the opposite directionHumanization and having the diaphragm vibrato affect timbre can be done similarly as withthe strings above, ensuring both LFOs are humanized in sync with each other, so they do notdrift apart. More special cases: Some instruments will have vibrato types which require special treatment, for example guitartremolo bridges will bend each string’s pitch by a different amount when playing chords. Thisrequires different pitch modulation depths for each string. Vibrato can also be used tomodulate [filter cutoffs][10], which is commonly used in synthesizers to createevolving pads or wobble basses. This is not difficult to implement. Here is an example of asynthesizer style vibrato with a typical lowpass filter, and vibrato which can affect pitch,volume or filter cutoff. //Filter//Lowpass filtercutoff=120cutoff_cc120=13200fil_keytrack=100resonance=0resonance_cc121=12//Vibratolfo01_freq=1lfo01_freq_oncc112=11lfo01_delay_oncc115=0. 500lfo01_fade_oncc116=0. 500lfo01_pitch_oncc111=22 //Vibrato LFO affects pitchlfo01_volume_oncc114=6 //Volume tremololfo01_cutoff=0 //Filter wobblelfo01_cutoff_oncc113=3600An unusual use of extremely deep vibrato and tremolo plus humanization is emulating vinylscratching. Pitch sweeps of 2+ octaves with strongly humanized LFO rate can resemble vinylscratching, though unlike real scratching, these LFOs are not controllable, and thereforerhythmic scratching is not an option. //Extreme vibrato that can resemble vinyl scratching//The depths are high but will be made even higher by the modulation of the LFO depthlfo01_pitch_oncc21=1333 //Extremely deep vibrato for vinyl emulationlfo01_freq=1lfo01_freq_oncc112=9//No delay but there is fadelfo01_fade_oncc116=0. 5//This LFO also does tremololfo01_volume_oncc21=7 //Again very heavylfo02_wave=1 //Second LFO to make things wobblierlfo02_phase=0lfo02_phase_oncc135=1 //Randomlfo02_freq=0. 01 //Basically no movement at very slow speeds, just randomizationlfo02_freq_oncc117=1 //Max rate is not very high, so it doesn't sound too obviouslfo02_freq_lfo01_oncc117=1 //Affect the rate of the other LFO for unsteady vibratolfo03_wave=1 //And a third LFO for secondhand complex wobblinesslfo03_phase=0. 4lfo03_phase_oncc135=0. 479 //Different phase response to velocity than the second LFOlfo03_freq=0. 5lfo03_freq_oncc117=-0. 4lfo03_freq_lfo2_oncc117=1lfo03_depth_lfo01=200lfo02_depth_lfo01=233eg1_level0_oncc117=1eg1_level1_oncc117=1eg1_depth_lfo2=100eg1_depth_lfo3=100This by no means exhausts all the possibilties of vibrato. It does provide a decent combination of control and realism for a lot of common instrument types, as well as some wild possibilities.

    "title": "Control of volume",
    "body": "The SFZ format allows many different ways of controlling volume. There’s themodulation of volume by opcodes, there’s velocity tracking, and there’s alsomodualtion by envelopes and LFOs. This is currently a work in progress, collecting information in tutorial form,though it might be turned into another type of page eventually. Opcodes affecting playback volume: The relevant opcodes are: [volume], [amplitude], [xfin / xfout], [amp_veltrack],[amp_keytrack], [amp_velcurve_N]. There are also envelope and LFO modulation sources: [ampeg], [amplfo], andvolume-related targets for egN and lfoN. Some of them will have multiple stages,points, CCs etc, so the volume of one sample can be affected by many different thingsat once. Velocity tracking: This is affected by amp_veltrack and amp_velcurve_N. In addition, vel2 modulationscan affect amp envelope durations as well as the sustain level (though not thepeak level at the end of the attack phase) and in ARIA extended CC 131 can alsomodulate things which affect volume, for example egN levels. Remember that amp_veltrack is 100 by default, so if dynamics are to be controlledby things other than velocity and dynamics should be controlled, for examle, bymod wheel, then set amp_veltrack to 0, as in the code example in the next section. When using velocity layers, remember that a quiet velocity layer will have a certainmax velocity, for example if a region has [hivel] set to 31, itwill never be triggered by velocities higher than 31, and therefore should usuallyeither have amp_velcurve_31 set to 1, or amp_veltrack should be set to 0. &lt;group&gt;hivel=42amp_velcurve_42=1#include  quiet_layer. sfz &lt;group&gt;lovel=43hivel=84amp_velcurve_84=1#include  middle_layer. sfz &lt;group&gt;lovel=85#include  loud_layer. sfz Volume, amplitude and crossfade: Volume, amplitude, and crossfade generally affect the playback volume of the entireregion, beginning to end. “Generally” because amplitude and volume can be modulatedby CCs while the sample is playing. Volume is additive and measured in decibels, so volume=6 adds 6 dB to the sample’splayback volume. Amplitude is multiplicative, and is a percentage of full amplitude,so amplitude=6 would mean the sample is played at 6% amplitude. Xfin and xfout are intended for cross-fading dynamic layers, and set the CC values forzero amplitude and full amplitude. One limitation here is that it’s not possible tohave a layer which has more than zero amplitude at the start of the fade-in. This isimportant for instruments such as bowed strings, which have a certain minimum practicalplayable loudness. These will often have dynamics linked to CC1 or some other CC, andneed to have some small amount of audible volume even at the lowest CC level. Here,amplitude with [curveccN] can be used to fade in the lowest layer. It’s still possible to use xfout to fade the layer out at higher CC values asthe next layer fades in, though it may be simpler to just use amplitude for all layers,for example like this: &lt;global&gt;amp_veltrack=0&lt;group&gt;amplitude_oncc1=100amplitude_curvecc1=11#include  quiet_layer. sfz &lt;group&gt;amplitude_oncc1=100amplitude_curvecc1=12#include  loud_layer. sfz &lt;curve&gt;curve_index=11v000=0. 4v063=1v127=0&lt;curve&gt;curve_index=12v000=0v063=0v127=1Envelopes and LFOs: Both the ampeg envelope and one or more egN flex envelopes can be used in parallel. The same is true of amplfo and lfoN flex LFOs. These affect the volume of theregion differently across time, obviously. Randomization: [amp_random] and its alias gain_random work like volume/gainand are measured in decibels. In ARIA and Cakewalk, amp_random is unipolar. In the rgc sfz player, amp_random is bipolar. In ARIA, CC135 (unipolar random) and 136 (bipolar random) can also be used byvarious opcodes which modulate volume. Stacking mutliple modulations: It is possible to have multiple CCs modulating the same opcode for the same region. This can make sense with multiple mic positions, for example. There can be a releasesamples volume control affecting release sample amplitude for all mics, and individualmic controls with the amplitude for all samples recorded through that mic. The effectwith amplitude would be multiplicative - so with either control at 0, there would beno sound. &lt;master&gt;amplitude_oncc80=100 //Close mic volume&lt;group&gt;#include  close_notes. sfz &lt;group&gt;trigger=releaseamplitude_oncc82=100 //Release noise volume#include  close_releases. sfz &lt;master&gt;amplitude_oncc81=100 //Far mic volume&lt;group&gt;#include  far_notes. sfz &lt;group&gt;trigger=releaseamplitude_oncc82=100 //Release noise volume#include  far_releases. sfz [curveccN]:    {{ ‘/modulations/curveccN’ | relative_url }}[amp_keytrack]:  {{ ‘/opcodes/amp_keytrack’ | relative_url }}[amp_random]:   {{ ‘/opcodes/amp_random’ | relative_url }}[amp_veltrack]:  {{ ‘/opcodes/amp_veltrack’ | relative_url }}[amp_velcurve_N]: {{ ‘/opcodes/amp_velcurve_N’ | relative_url }}[ampeg]:     {{ ‘/opcodes/ampeg_attack’ | relative_url }}[amplfo]:     {{ ‘/opcodes/amplfo_depth’ | relative_url }}[amplitude]:   {{ ‘/opcodes/amplitude’ | relative_url }}[hivel]:     {{ ‘/opcodes/hivel’ | relative_url }}[volume]:     {{ ‘/opcodes/volume’ | relative_url }}[xfin / xfout]:  {{ ‘/opcodes/xfin_loccN’ | relative_url }} "
